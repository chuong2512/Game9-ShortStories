    name: The Walk
    content: "Alice was everywhere, until she wasn\u2019t. Just like at first, she
      was nowhere until she was. The absence of her before I knew she existed, was
      nothing. Now, the absence of her shrouds everything. Like a guest who never
      came to dinner; a stormy sky that didn\u2019t deliver. Nothing can wash away
      the void where she used to be. This is what I\u2019m thinking about the first
      time I take The Walk without her.  I met Alice at a dinner party, the raucous
      kind with wild guests, beautiful people glittering in late summer air on a
      second-floor balcony backlit by a September sky. We were all friends of Richard,
      and this was his brilliant attempt to make all the people I love come together.
      Or it was a lavish birthday party thrown for himself. You could never quite
      tell with Richard.  He was my hairdresser, but I was included among the people
      he loved the most, and so was Alice. From across the table, her eyes kept locking
      mine with interest: hers large and dark and layered with mischief. Her husband
      was older, serene. A balm to her boisterousness.  I know you from somewhere,
      she\u2019d said, that night when there was both sweltering heat and a prelude
      of autumn in the air. We sipped deep, earthy Bordeaux and had the getting-to-know-you
      conversation. The what-do-you-do, are-you-married, do-you-have-kids variety. 
      A week later, on my morning run with Copper, I ran into Alice again and now
      we knew. This is where I see you! We both exclaimed it as we came into each
      other\u2019s space on the trail, the wide, flat former track bed for trains.
      Copper panted at my side, not used to the interruption in our run. Alice was
      delighted. Although she didn\u2019t run, I agreed to slow it to a power walk
      and changed direction, pulling a confused Copper along. The winds shifted:
      the weather and my life, simultaneously.  I had been passing Alice on the trail
      forever. Her Nordic ponytail, so blonde it was nearly white, had been in my
      peripheral vision for years. In the winter she was encapsulated in bright,
      good-quality warmth: red Patagonia outerwear and a multi-colored hat from another
      dimension, such was the insanity of its pattern. Her body was fit and lithe;
      ageless, from a lifetime of The Walk.  The Walk is so important, she\u2019d
      tell me, but she didn\u2019t have to tell me. I stopped running, and my knees
      responded with finally! For the love of God stop trying to break us, you aren\u2019t
      young anymore! Alice, who I had flown by in summers before, barely noticing
      her, became my near daily companion and without the run, The Walk became essential.
      My knees, at age forty, were dissolving like broken concrete, but I still needed
      the exercise, and, as it turns out, the companionship.  We figured out that
      winter we\u2019d been passing each other more places than the trail. We had
      circled each other forever, near collisions and missed encounters. Richard
      was the hub that had put us on the balcony that night, Richard who collected
      people like trophies, beautiful and successful ones. His Instagram had thousands
      of followers.  But he doesn\u2019t really have friends, you know? Alice observed,
      and I agreed. Richard was a perpetuator of vanity posting and humble brags,
      king of the selfie with #nofilter. In person, you could see the ruddy undertones
      of his skin and his bleached hair wasn\u2019t quite so effervescent. His need
      to be complimented was painfully obvious, like a giant cut that oozed blood
      and begged for stitches.  We discussed Richard at length, chiding ourselves
      for gossip but agreeing: what we talked about on The Walk, stayed on The Walk.
      It wasn\u2019t only Richard. Soon, we discovered that we\u2019d both worked
      in the same office building, for years. She: the owner of a tiny, liberal magazine.
      She had sat on comfy couches in jeans and sweaters drinking herbal tea and
      brainstorming how to get her writers to be better on the fourth floor. One
      level down, I had worn tailored suits in muted, professional colors\u2014dove
      gray, classic black, the occasional cobalt blue. My hair was perfectly coifed
      (thanks to Richard) and I wore red lipstick and heels and traded stocks for
      rich people while advising them how to invest their life.  We must have seen
      each other a million times! I wracked my memory, trying find one in which Alice
      and I ride in the elevator together. I would have everything tightly in my
      leather bag, some feminized version of a briefcase, clasped with both hands
      in front of me, mentally running through the daily to-do list that forever
      plagued me. Alice would have been in leggings, a messenger bag slung over her
      body and a cardboard container with coffees for all her employees.  No memory
      came, but we could not get over how wild the universe was. We had shared that
      space for just under seven years, before Alice sold the magazine and retired
      and before I quit my job when I was faced with dragons to slay in the form
      of a mental breakdown.  But it wasn\u2019t just work and Richard. We soon realized
      that we had both been at the wedding of Cassidy and Brian, who had also attended
      Richard\u2019s party. Brian was a colleague of mine; I had known him for years.
      Cassidy was Alice\u2019s neighbor before she married Brian. Both of us had
      frequently double-dated with them. Alice and the Zen husband who was placid
      like a golden retriever on tranquilizers. Me and David, before he died.  We
      were a good year into The Walk before I talked about David. Before I told Alice
      the story of how we were together forever, pushing off marriage because we
      were focused on our careers. Someday, we\u2019d said, passing like strangers
      in the night, as I left for work and he stumbled home from his life as an ER
      doctor.  On The Walk, one day, I break down so violently we have to stop. It\u2019s
      been two years since David died. It\u2019s been one year since I walked away
      from my job in an attempt to salvage myself. It\u2019s been just under one
      year since I stopped running and started Walking with Alice. She doesn\u2019t
      say anything, and even Copper lies down on the path. He\u2019s a Vizsla, and
      he\u2019s already pissed about not running anymore, but he\u2019s the only
      one who has ever been born witness to this level of rawness.  Alice doesn\u2019t
      say a word, and for this I fall in love with her. I have put up a wall between
      myself and every other well-meaning person in my life who has tried to compartmentalize
      my feelings, to attach names like grief or anger to the gaping hole in my life.
      As if the space where David lived could be defined. As if they could quantify
      what it meant to lose him.  After that day, Alice asks me only once about David,
      and its only his name. I tell her, and her eyes grow wide and she stops The
      Walk to tell me that she was married before the Zen husband. For a long time.
      And that one day he had a heart attack, as workaholic men do, and the ER doctor
      who tried to save him was named Dr. David Cross.  Was it him? she asks me,
      tears glistening like a lighthouse beacon, flavored with something far away.
      I nod, rapt with hunger to hear of the moment when Alice met David. She tells
      me how it went down. How very young the doctor seemed. How he also cried, blinked
      back tears, as he sat in the room with her, the one where they took people
      to tell them that their loved one didn\u2019t make it.  David often came home
      with the broken heart of a man trying to meld science and God. So often, he
      laid his head on me, told me a story\u2014a mother falling to her knees, a
      husband. A wife. I tried to extract the memory, so sure was I that he must
      have cried into my hair one dark morning about Alice. Must have told me about
      the beautiful blonde woman with the supple body that had fully expected her
      husband to make it.  My God, its like we were supposed to meet! Alice recovers
      from the brief trip back in time, to a place where darkness kept her isolated
      until the Zen husband materialized. It was like Dorothy arriving in Kansas
      when he did. It wasn\u2019t home, not exactly, but everything was beautiful
      and colorful and magical again.  Most of The Walks were not so deep. Alice
      was older than me, a young septuagenarian. She was certain I\u2019d fall in
      love again, so much so that she told me not to worry about it and to let her
      handle it. I laughed and indulged her, saying yes when she suggested we take
      The Walk into her neighborhood because there\u2019s a very, very cute man who
      lives on the corner and I\u2019ve already told him I have a hot stockbroker
      friend!  We did The Walk in all the seasons. Winter was Alice\u2019s favorite,
      when the air was the cleanest and Copper shone like fire against the snow.
      Alice convinced me to let him loose, assuring me that once he was free, he
      would never leave. Her logic made no sense, and yet she was right. After nearly
      a decade of straining on his leash, Copper took a few laps and returns to us,
      contentedly sniffing along.    Summer was my favorite, with the sun that turned
      me golden for the first time in years, as I was no longer in an office for
      ten hours a day. I was circling a drain of my own imposing, a two-year mark
      in which carefully allocated funds would be used up, and I'd have to return
      to work. Alice said screw that and reminded me that I know how to make more
      money, that I\u2019m the investment genius after all. I told her it\u2019s
      not that simple, but I cannot help delighting in the way my hair has lightened
      and the way the day feels like forever when you\u2019re outside to enjoy it. 
      We both love fall; after all, this is when we met for the first time on a conscious
      plane of existence. We commemorated two years of knowing each other one September
      morning, agreeing to abort The Walk in favor of breakfast. Alice said she'd
      pick me up, that she knew a great little diner off the beaten path. She took
      me to a place called The Bean, and I suppose I should've be shocked but I wasn't,
      not after all this time.  I love this place, she says to me. I used to get
      coffee almost every morning on my way to work.  Me too, I say, and inside she
      revealed her ulterior motive for bringing me here, to a place I haven\u2019t
      once visited or come to since my self-imposed sabbatical.  Look, she whispered,
      as if we were detectives solving a crime. No, don\u2019t be obvious! Look at
      the guy behind the counter!  I eyed the barista and rolled my eyes. While I
      agreed that he was adorable, I reminded Alice that I\u2019m forty-two years
      old and the barista is a child, maybe twenty if that. Alice didn't care.  Age
      is just a number! Look at the Zen husband! He\u2019s years older than me. It
      doesn\u2019t matter! I\u2019m telling you. Your soulmate is right around the
      corner, I can feel it.  Before I could say that David was my soulmate, she
      waved her hand as if brushing a fly off my shoulder. She pushed my coffee across
      the table towards me, she held the moment with her eyes and her secret smile.
      We have lots of soulmates, don\u2019t you think? I gushed with gratitude inside,
      knowing what she wasn\u2019t saying. This friendship, this life we\u2019ve
      led alongside one another without even knowing about it, has undoubtedly been
      orchestrated by some type of higher power.  When spring comes, Alice insists
      that she\u2019s very close to figuring out who my new soulmate will be, and
      that she\u2019ll be the one to introduce us. I\u2019m telling you, this is
      happening!  I side-eye her, ash-colored hair trailing in the spring breeze
      that\u2019s rousing all the pollen, the main reason Alice dislikes spring.
      She carries an inhaler and has tissues in her pocket even though I suggest
      we skip on days when the pollen count is high. I\u2019ve started to believe
      that she\u2019s correct and feel a bit excited for the future. I tack on another
      six months to my sabbatical.  The Walk has become a near daily staple. Alice
      has become the best friend I\u2019ve ever had. Copper is settling into his
      geriatric-hood with ease, like a fresh sheet billowing over a bed. The dark
      parts of my life have feathered away into just strands, and I have spent gobs
      of money on a therapist but both he and I agree The Walk has been an even greater
      part of my healing. David can now exist in my mind with bittersweet nostalgia
      instead of shards of pain.  One day in late April, Alice collapses on The Walk. 
      It\u2019s preposterous\u2014Alice is healthy and we walk daily and she does
      yoga and Pilates and spin and takes an adult tap class\u2014but there she is,
      lying on the packed dirt that is dry already from a spring where rain eludes
      us. Copper panics, and when he does, I know something is horribly wrong. I
      don\u2019t know what to do\u2014I don\u2019t know CPR and other than her asthma,
      I don\u2019t know what could be wrong. In the end, I dial 911, and the operator
      tries to guide me through resuscitation. My lips feel gummy against Alice\u2019s;
      my hands feel as though they are crossing some boundary as they push heavily
      on her chest.  Come on, I say to her, and in my head, I\u2019m already narrating
      the story we will tell, of how she collapsed, and I saved her. We will tell
      our friends at dinner and there will be some innocuous but easily fixable culprit:
      a heart valve that\u2019s repaired perfectly, a piece of chewing gum that became
      lodged in her airway. Nothing that will change anything at all.  The story,
      it turns out, ends with Alice dying.  I go in the ambulance with Alice, a vaguely
      familiar hiker at the head of the trail offering to take Copper back home and
      deposit him into my fenced in yard. Copper\u2019s eyes tell me it\u2019s okay,
      that he will be safe with this stranger. In the waiting room of the ER, I dial
      the Zen husband, but I only get his voicemail. I leave him a message, keeping
      it breezy, because I\u2019m still writing the fantasy in my head where she
      lives.  But she doesn\u2019t. The doctor who comes out to tell me is astonishingly
      handsome. He looks like David if David had been allowed to age. I collapse
      into a primal howl, I seem to shake both of us, as if a widow and an ER doctor
      were new to death. Brain aneurysm, he tells me.  When I leave, he assures me
      the Zen husband is on his way and not to worry, he will handle it. But it doesn\u2019t
      matter. Alice is gone. I Uber myself home, eternally grateful to find that
      Copper\u2019s babysitter has done what I\u2019ve asked and deposited him in
      my backyard. I collapse on my couch, wanting David. Wanting Alice. I have lived
      too much of my life without her and now, she dies? It\u2019s not fair. I will
      never Walk without her, I vow.  Days later, I break the vow, because of Copper.
      Because I want to leave a note at the trailhead to thank the man who I trusted
      with Copper and my address and my gate code. Because Copper is a Vizsla, and
      he needs exercise. I am achingly aware of the empty space beside me, like a
      bubble that has popped. I would give anything to see Alice round the bend ahead,
      her familiar gait, one of her crazy hats and her wild blonde hair.  But she
      doesn\u2019t, and when I get to the point where we usually turn around, I sit
      down and cry again. I can hear her, I swear I can, as if the wind rustling
      is really her and my magical thinking is really true. After awhile it calms
      down and everything is silent again. When I stand to turn back, the leash-less
      Copper bolts ahead to inspect a person who\u2019s come around the bend. Again,
      for a half-second, I dream that its Alice.  It\u2019s not Alice, but by some
      strange coincidence, it\u2019s the man who took Copper home for me. Incredulously,
      I show him the note I was going to post, I pump his hand in thanks and when
      I touch him, I feel something pass between us, as if I\u2019ve been here before.
      I can tell he feels it too. Copper pants beside us.  This might seem weird,
      the man says, but do you want to walk with me?  Okay, I say, and Copper takes
      off ahead of us.  Is your friend okay? He asks this with genuine concern, with
      kindness, and the jolt of remembrance nearly knocks me off-balance. I can hear
      Alice\u2019s words: I\u2019m going to find him for you, your next soulmate.
      I suddenly realize, without a doubt, that she\u2019s fulfilled her promise.
      I have no logical reason for believing this, and yet, I do.  She didn\u2019t
      make it, I breathe out, and I find myself telling the story of Alice and our
      parallel lives and explaining The Walk and how much I miss her\u2014telling
      it all to this stranger. We start talking about our lives and we don\u2019t
      stop for the entire Walk.  Up ahead, Copper runs free."

    name: The Ungentling
    content: "Bill\u2019s disappeared upstairs with the little sickly girl but me
      I\u2019m here to see the blind woman. I hear she did it on purpose, tore donkey
      tail out of the earth and smeared its milky sap directly in her eyes. It must
      of stung her hands and face bad and maybe left marks on her fingers. Near Santa
      Fe, men, women and children are always getting possessed of this sort of ecstasy
      and seem like taking pleasure in swallowing poison and fire and stepping on
      scorpions and suchlike. But it ain\u2019t superstition like the government
      try to tell me in the last war. Superstition I know \u2014 that\u2019s when
      you got to tie your right boot afore your left, or when like they say you can
      shoot your brother when he wears gray but not if he wears blue. It does make
      a sort of sense, long as you don\u2019t look at it head-on and just leave it
      ghostly in the peripheral. But Bill don\u2019t like superstition. He explained
      it all to me after we strangled that poor boy at Fort Smith. \u201CWe done
      nothing \u2019cept kill \u2019em for two years and now you\u2019re boo-hooing
      over another one,\u201D he growled, and I thought and thought about it and
      figured he was right.   But the blindness is no superstition. Even Bill\u2019s
      got to know that.   I turn from the lamps and laughter and follow the proprietor
      to the musky rear of the whorehouse. He ain\u2019t Anastasio like it was during
      the Mexican War. He\u2019s someone smaller and younger than I guess Anastasio
      would be now but with his same unreadable black eyes like pools of tar, sullen
      and restless. He leads me down a short flight of steps and under a wooden lintel
      so low I got to stoop.   \u201CYou speak English?\u201D   He jerks his head
      vaguely, without comprehension.   \u201CI seen a Roman priest here today. You
      people say at the end a\u2019 the day the love a\u2019 God and love a\u2019
      women are one and the same. Guess that\u2019s how come at the end a\u2019 the
      day you got the prostitutes, prophetess, and padres all under one and the same
      roof!\u201D   Bill thought that one was funny when I told it him. It don\u2019t
      have much effect on Anastasio\u2019s heir. \u201CPerd\xF3n, se\xF1or,\u201D
      he mutters, and nearly shoves me to a chair I can\u2019t hardly see for the
      darkness.   The room\u2019s lit only by two candles set afore a holy picture
      in the far corner. It\u2019s the same picture as sixteen years ago: a gloomy
      and gory Jesus-on-the-Cross with white and wild eyes rolling back in his head.
      It makes me sick to see. I don\u2019t take much stock in any sort of Jesus
      but if I got to choose I\u2019d prefer Jesus-the-Good-Shepherd or Jesus-Blesses-the-Little-Children.
      I\u2019ve my own fondness for children, if you can believe it. Maybe she\u2019s
      lighted \u2019em specially for my benefit \u2014 a blind woman don\u2019t need
      candles. Well, she shouldn\u2019t of bothered. I stare at his face with distaste,
      so disturbed I don\u2019t notice her already sitting across from me.   I suffer
      a whole series of shocks. First, that she\u2019s in the room and I didn\u2019t
      know it. Second, that her hair\u2019s still the thick, darkish red I remember,
      untouched by the intervening years. Her face ain\u2019t so lucky \u2014 the
      third shock \u2014 pocked and wrinkled and spotted and pouched unpleasantly.
      She looks old, lot older than me anyhow. It\u2019s a shame. She\u2019d been
      a real beautiful woman once if it hadn\u2019t of been for the eyes.   Her eyes
      like the eyes of Jesus don\u2019t look maybe how you\u2019d expect. They\u2019re
      mostly shut, and I wish she\u2019d just shut \u2019em all the way and be done
      with it. That way she\u2019d look soft and gentle so as to gladden the hearts
      of men. But problem is she don\u2019t shut \u2019em. There\u2019s always that
      sickening white and wild stripe Anastasio told me had ruined her for ordinary
      work. \u201CWe cannot always keep the ones with holy sickness,\u201D he confided
      in me in his odd English that cold night in January of \u201947. I\u2019d been
      left in the New Mexico Territory to rot with a thousand other American soldiers,
      liable to die like dogs of the bloody shits. \u201CThey are who are called
      las desad\xF3ciles \u2014 the ungentle ones.\u201D   Her breath comes in labored
      shudders. I watch the whites of her eyes flicker and dart; I feel strangely
      that she\u2019s watching me. Without my meaning to, my own breath shifts to
      match her pace: slow, deliberate, each hauled from below like one of the last
      few of a precious cache. Her spider-webbed hand creeps across the table to
      find mine, lean and hairy.   \u201CTe recuerdo.\u201D   I jump a little.  
      \u201CYou are changed.\u201D Her voice is aged but clear, neutral like she
      don\u2019t care so much whether or not I have.   \u201CYou too, Esperanza,\u201D
      I say hopefully, uneasily. I wonder what it is she can see. I lift my other
      hand to trace the scar across my cheekbone, clumsily stitched and even more
      clumsily healed \u2014 a habit developed after Pericles trampled it at Little
      Rock. The poor horse did it on accident but that don\u2019t stop me getting
      rheumatism of the face as the eternal consequence. Ain\u2019t been a good thing
      in the winter. \u201CThere\u2019s a war again but it ain\u2019t with the Mexicans
      this time. It\u2019s against ourselves.\u201D   I figure that might impress
      her. But she don\u2019t respond to the news.   \u201CYou are a murderer and
      a thief,\u201D she says simply in the same neutral, level tone.   \u201CYou\u2019re
      a whore and a liar.\u201D My fingers tighten slightly round her wrist. Her
      pulse carries on beneath their hold with maddening indifference. \u201CI ain\u2019t
      any more a killer or thief than I ever was. You ever lay night after night
      after night on the rock, dizzy and burning and freezing with pain, groaning
      for a death that never comes? And wasn\u2019t anyone cared. Soon as I could
      walk they threw me back up on a horse and marched me through Arkansas. It\u2019s
      the 8th Missouri Cavalry as stole from me \u2014 it\u2019s them as tried to
      kill me. Bill and me took our due, I figure, and we\u2019ll be in California
      come spring. I ain\u2019t no thief.\u201D I think of the strangled boy, his
      tongue lolling purple from a blue and yellow face. \u201CAnd that guard was
      just another grayback. I b\u2019lieve I shot dozens a\u2019 others afore him.
      They don\u2019t count neither \u2014 they\u2019re enemies a\u2019 the Union.\u201D 
      My knuckles are nearly white. I slacken, surprised, and pause to see if Esperanza
      is at all moved.   \u201CYou are making a confession?\u201D  \u201CNo, I ain\u2019t.
      I\u2019m here for prophecy, not forgiveness. I don\u2019t need it. And you
      was wrong that last time. About Bill. He never hurt me none.\u201D My mind
      glances back suddenly over the stretch of sixteen years, of my old farm in
      Greene County, the venture, the loss and despair, the faint shimmer of escape
      I thought the army would afford me one last time. Foolishness \u2014 vanity
      of vanities! I clear my throat. \u201CBill\u2019s a heartless old bastard but
      he\u2019s alright. He\u2019s all I got now.\u201D  \u201CWhat is it you want?\u201D 
      \u201CProphecy, goddammit!\u201D My fist hits the table with a resounding bang.
      \u201CYou\u2019re costing me five times as much as any a\u2019 the other girls.\u201D
      I\u2019m ashamed to say what I\u2019d dreamed the past couple months in those
      quiet hours twixt waking and sleep. I\u2019d dreamed maybe she\u2019d love
      me this time. Maybe this time she\u2019d know I was different from the others,
      the Bills and Anastasios she knew best. Maybe I could rescue her \u2014 maybe
      the red hair and milky eyes I couldn\u2019t forget would remember me. \u201CTe
      recuerdo\u201D did she say? Does she know who I am? I\u2019d rather she don\u2019t.
      And for a fleet second I know what the Mexicans know about the love of God
      and of women.  Esperanza\u2019s eyelids flutter open to reveal the amber crescents
      of irises long since out of use. She pants in haggard and rhythmless breaths.
      \u201CYou are a slave to yourself in a dark world,\u201D she rasps \u2014 no
      soft clearness now \u2014 I try to scrounge up some disgust for this old hag
      I\u2019d come to worship. \u201CYou trust in the lies of man, in the false
      burdens of time and distance, of flux, of entrance and exit. You are blind
      in your sight. Find and follow the narrow path of the real, the self not itself
      emptied of itself. This alone is worthy of your life and your death.\u201D 
      She throws her head back and wails, a long high wail like a coyote\u2019s,
      containing within itself the nameless grief of thousands of years \u2014 the
      howl of the desad\xF3ciles. Her hand creeps along my arm. My skull starts to
      burn. The room whirls white-hot. Then I\u2019m pulled upward, out of the dark
      room, out of the whorehouse, out into cold air over the small city of Santa
      Fe, then higher till the whole of the Sangre de Cristo range shows afore me.
      I see the route me and Bill took out of Colorado into the city all at once.
      I watch a sharp westerly whip snow into life what must be many miles beneath
      me.  The atmosphere warms. A pink and orange glow spreads like moss over the
      mountains. Their summits melt into rivers and pour into the valleys, so many
      libations to an unknown god. Deserts blossom into cactus flower and the silent
      teem of insects. Forests thicken and scream with an obscene abundance of life,
      then hush into the brown pallor of autumn. My head aches with the effort to
      hold it all in, to see all there is to see.  Railroads are born. Criss-crossing
      like snakes or poisoned veins they dart through the Rockies, through the country
      and south of the city. Noise and smoke like you couldn\u2019t imagine ascend
      to the heavens. Santa Fe explodes in concrete and lights. Nights and days pass
      with bewildering rapidity as fire and poison and concrete stretch and stink.
      The Sangre de Cristos begin to erode. So does the city, until the whole terrain
      is rubbed layer by layer, brick by brick into smooth lumps of sand. The sun
      reaches out a hand and engulfs the planet. I want to cry out Stop stop but
      I can\u2019t. I don\u2019t know that I have a mouth to speak.  And just as
      suddenly the scene reverses. Mountains rear their heads. The railways peel
      away like spruce gum. I\u2019m back to where, or when, I started. The wind
      seems to retreat, siphoning ice off the peaks. Leaves rise from rocks and fasten
      themselves to trees, then shrink and swell with springtime juices. Faster and
      faster time turns on itself; covered wagons and traders on horses stream back
      eastward; flocks and herds migrate, depart, return; Comanche and Apache mingle,
      raid, and clash with Spaniards.   Even faster now. Great beasts like hairy
      elephants rage, then give way to jungles of reptilian horror. Mountains wax
      and wane, wax and wane \u2014 the globe spins like a top \u2014 flood covers
      the earth. The waters recede. Now darkness, a formless void, and a light like
      a single pinprick. I am blind; that pinprick is all that\u2019s left.  **************************************************** 
      I\u2019m lying outside, mouth agape, when Bill finds me.   \u201CLooks like
      the old girl treated you right.\u201D He nudges my unresponsive side with the
      toe of his boot. \u201CSure don\u2019t make \u2019em like they used to, tell
      you what. The little one, what\u2019s-her-name \u2014 I swear she ain\u2019t
      worked a day in her life. I like \u2019em better when \u2014\u201D  \u201CYou
      leave me alone, Bill.\u201D  His hulking shadow starts. \u201CHngh?\u201D 
      \u201CI figure you heard me.\u201D I struggle to my feet.  \u201CWhaddya mean,
      Paul?\u201D  \u201CI mean leave me alone. We\u2019re going our separate ways.
      And don\u2019t you ever again dare talk about her like that. You hear me?\u201D 
      Bill\u2019s gristly face scowls. \u201CThat right? And who\u2019s gi  tting
      our cash, I wonder?\u201D  \u201CI don\u2019t care about no cash. Take all
      the cash in the world, Bill. Hell, take all the gold in California. I got to
      go back. I\u2019m going to Fort Smith. I\u2019m going back to the regiment.\u201D 
      Bill yanks me up by the collar and shakes till everything goes in circles again.
      \u201CYou\u2019re gonna confess, is it? Got religion all of a sudden cause
      a old lady don\u2019t like your looks? Real noble, your confessing for the
      both of us. Well I don\u2019t like that, Paul. I don\u2019t like that at all.\u201D
      He drops me gasping to the ground. Dazed, I try again to stand. Bill makes
      quick work of me \u2014 he once beat a bare-knuckle boxer who traveled round
      challenging folks to matches \u2014 three blows to the head and I\u2019m flat
      on the ground. He looks at me, hesitates, then brings his foot down hard. My
      nose bursts in a bloom of scarlet; my skull fractured once by a frightened
      warhorse shoots with flame.  \u201CHate to do it to you, Paul,\u201D he shouts
      over his shoulder. \u201CCan\u2019t have you whining like a girl to no authorities
      afore I git out. I thought you was my friend!\u201D Bill\u2019s already on
      his way out of town.  I roll to my back. Blood flows into my eyes but I can
      still make out the stars. And I weep like a child, ungentled."

    name: Echelon
    content: "Leaning against a tarnished railing aboard a ferry, Katherine watched
      ocean waves curl into themselves. Close to her chest, she held a pewter urn
      containing her mother\u2019s cremated remains. She breathed deeply, the taste
      of brine caking her tongue like damp ash. The midday sun reflected in droplets
      that quavered on the balusters, then trickled down like little rivulets, only
      to reappear from the periodic spray of waves breaking against the prow. Other
      ferry goers chattered around her, though Katherine was only vaguely aware of
      them. Her thoughts were on the last conversation she had with her mother. All
      this time out on the ocean, chasing fish \u2014  \u201CMommy, do you think
      we\u2019ll see a whale today?\u201D asked a little girl in polka-dots and a
      wide-brimmed straw hat, her voice somehow cutting through the din.  \u201CI
      hope so,\u201D her mother replied, dressed in flowy linen pants and wearing
      lipstick the color of strawberries.  The oversized straw hat reminded Katherine
      of a cowboy hat she tried to wear when she was young. It was oversized too,
      and quickly made her forehead sweat. It would shift down over her eyes as she
      galloped around the house, pretending to be a rancher, or cowboy, or sheriff
      chasing after an outlaw who was always a beautiful woman who smiled deviously,
      smoke curling from between her teeth, bullet holes perforating her own rawhide
      cowboy hat, an image that caused Katherine to grow warm and jittery and, inevitably,
      trip or bump into a wall, a table, her mother\u2019s legs.  \u201CTake that
      thing off,\u201D her mother had said.  \u201CBut I\u2019m a cowboy!\u201D 
      \u201CCowgirl. And cowgirls don\u2019t need to wear boys\u2019 hats like this.
      Take it off, I\u2019ll buy you a prettier one.\u201D  \u201CBut I like this
      one. It was daddy\u2019s.\u201D  With a serene smile, her mother gently lifted
      the hat away from her head, and Katherine will never forget the noiseless way
      she turned, almost perfectly on an axis, as though a steel wire ran through
      her core connecting her floor-to-ceiling, or the white of her knuckles she
      crumpled the hat into the kitchen garbage can.  The little girl in the polka-dots
      bumped into Katherine\u2019s leg accidentally; her straw hat fell atop Katherine\u2019s
      feet.  \u201COh my gosh, I am so sorry!\u201D her mother exclaimed.  \u201CIt\u2019s
      okay,\u201D Katherine replied.  \u201CMelissa,\u201D the woman said, turning
      to her daughter, \u201Csay you\u2019re sorry. We can\u2019t go around bumping
      into people, especially not on a boat.\u201D  \u201CI\u2019m sorry for bumping
      into you on a boat,\u201D Melissa said, looking down so her tangled mass of
      curls covered her face.  Katherine knelt down and retrieved the hat, handed
      it over to Melissa. \u201CYou know, I used to have a hat kind of like this.
      It was a little too big for me, so I\u2019d run into stuff all the time. The
      trick is you\u2019ve got to angle it up, like this.\u201D She placed it on
      Melissa\u2019s head slantways, the front brim almost perpendicular to the sky.
      \u201CPlus, if you keep the brim away from your eyes, you can catch sight of
      a whale better. Around here, you\u2019re looking for a gray whale. They leave
      big splashes that you can see from miles away, so watch the horizon. Or sometimes
      they\u2019re sneaky, and do this thing called spy hopping, where they\u2019ll
      just peek their heads out enough to see where they are. Watch for that too.\u201D 
      Melissa\u2019s mouth gaped. \u201CHow do you know so much about whales?\u201D 
      \u201CI\u2019m a cetologist \u2014 a whale scientist.\u201D  \u201CThat\u2019s
      so cool! Mommy, did you hear that?\u201D  \u201CI did,\u201D she replied, her
      voice lilting as her gaze lingered on the urn Katherine cradled.  \u201CWell,
      it was nice meeting you Melissa. Keep your eyes open, there\u2019s bound to
      be some whales out today.\u201D  Melissa said thanks and returned to her mother\u2019s
      side, who mouthed thank you, then parted her strawberry lips as though to give
      condolences, but decided better, and instead smiled with crinkled eyes that
      said sorry for your loss as she turned and meandered further along the railing,
      pulling her daughter close to her side.  Echelon. That\u2019s the supportive
      position a mother whale takes with her calf while swimming, to reduce the water
      drag. This means, of course, the mother must take on excess water drag. Katherine
      looked down at the urn, sunlight glinting off its smooth edges. Her mother
      had loved whales \u2014 cetaceans, as Katherine now thought of them. Her mother\u2019s
      favorite was the gray whale, in fact. She had known little to nothing about
      gray whales, however; the preference was purely sentimental. She\u2019d tell
      Katherine she went whale-watching with her father on the happiest day of her
      life, pausing for effect before delivering her coup de grace: that it was the
      day she found out she was pregnant. She said this often enough that Katherine
      could recite the second half of the phrase, rhythm, inflection and all, and
      would do so with rolled eyes, much to her mother\u2019s chagrin. As a cetologist,
      Katherine knew that the average gray whale was approximately forty-five meters
      in length. She knew they weighed between thirty and forty tons, and that they
      were bottom feeders, turning laterally to skim the ocean floor, sifting stirred
      up sediment through their baleen, keeping the food and sieving out the rest.
      She knew their lives revolved around two things: one half of a year was spent
      gorging themselves, hopefully storing enough fat to make the long migration
      south, where during the second half of the year they would mate and rear their
      young. Once the calf was grown enough, it was time to make the treacherous
      journey back north. Had her mother known all this, she may have loved them
      more \u2014 or disliked them. Similarity breeds either camaraderie or resentment,
      there isn\u2019t really any in between. Katherine\u2019s mother had devoted
      her life to supporting her daughter, never remarrying, always working, and
      always, always keeping her in echelon. It\u2019s part of what made their last
      conversation so difficult to stomach.  \u201CMommy, look!\u201D Melissa cried.  
      Katherine saw it too \u2014 something gray and sleek, gliding just beneath
      the waves, not far from the bow. Her heart leapt; she leaned over the edge,
      taking care to redouble her grip on the urn. Was it a porpoise? No, too large.
      A whale? The size was right, but this was unlike any whale she\u2019d ever
      studied. Whales lumbered. This, this shot through the water like a torpedo.
      After a moment, it disappeared abruptly into the depths, like a dumbbell dropped
      into the ocean.   Katherine shook her head in disbelief, peered closer to be
      sure nothing was there.   \u201CMommy, where\u2019d the whale go?\u201D  \u201CI
      don\u2019t know, maybe it\u2019ll come back up! Let\u2019s keep watching.\u201D 
      \u201CBut where did it\u2026\u201D  Katherine had no idea what they had just
      seen, but she knew it was no whale. Her breath quickened as the slap of the
      waves against the prow and the conversation between Melissa and her mother
      became muted. Dark and ominous, the deep whisked past with a cool urgency. 
      Then, an explosion of water nearby, too loud to be a whale\u2019s breach. Heads
      turned. Melissa\u2019s hat fell to the deck. Out of the ocean, a matte gray
      object slid silently toward the sky, impossibly fast. It had already reached
      the clouds by the time droplets from its breach began falling into the bay,
      their pattering deafening compared to the absolute silence of the flying object.
      The craft stopped half-in half-out of cloud cover\u2019s edge, immediate and
      precise, yet with an ease that indicated it carried no inertia. It hovered,
      then began slowly rotating. It was oblong, with small teal lights pulsing in
      a steady line down its center, as though it were breathing.   Everyone aboard
      the ferry was silent. The sky itself seemed to lurch with the waves. Then,
      a mass of cumulus above the craft began to warp, as though God was pressing
      his thumb through tissue paper. But instead of a great whorled print, what
      pressed through was the long, rectangular nose of another craft, twice as large
      as the first. The smaller oblong craft attached to the bottom of it. Blue electricity
      arced along their fuselages, then the two craft, reunited, alighted soundlessly
      into the generous clouds. Melissa began to cry. People looked at one another,
      back at the sky, down at the ocean. Murmurs began rolling across the deck like
      pebbles preceding an avalanche.   A searing white light flashed across the
      bay, so quickly that Katherine had no time to shield her eyes. For a brief
      moment, there was intense pain, then utter silence. Everywhere, a pure infinite
      white. No ocean, no sky, no way to orient. Katherine couldn\u2019t tell if
      she was floating, standing, or lying down. She did know that she was alone.
      She hugged herself close and began to shake, panic welling up rapidly.  \u201CHello,\u201D
      came a voice, gentle and sonorous, surrounding her yet also within her.   A
      silhouetted figure appeared in the distance, like an inky black pupil in the
      infinite white. It seemed humanoid; but, when it raised its arm there was the
      outline of a chitinous claw where there should\u2019ve been fleshy fingers
      and a meaty palm. The silhouette\u2019s arm, upheld, moved gingerly left, then
      right, then left.  \u201CWhat \u2014 what the hell is going on?\u201D Katherine
      stammered.   \u201CYou may be at ease,\u201D assured the being, and against
      her will Katherine\u2019s feelings immediately released into a deep sense of
      spacious warmth. She knew this feeling \u2014 the feeling of curling up next
      to her mother when she was very young, a plush blanket covering them both,
      her mother braiding her hair as they watched The Beauty and the Beast for the
      fifteenth time. Safe. Space, warmth, safety, they seemed boundless then, as
      they did now.  \u201CWhat are you doing to me\u2026why can\u2019t I be scared
      right now?\u201D  \u201CDo you wish to feel fear?\u201D asked the being, cocking
      its head inquisitively.  \u201CI \u2014 I feel like I should.\u201D  The being
      paused for a moment, as though to consider its next words carefully. \u201CHow
      do you know what you should do?\u201D   The question sparked another memory;
      Katherine\u2019s last conversation with her mother before she passed:  \u201CAll
      this time out on the ocean, chasing whales \u2014\u201D  \u201CCetaceans, Mom.\u201D 
      \u201CCetaceans. You\u2019re so beautiful, I can\u2019t for the life of me
      understand why you never spend any time dating.\u201D  \u201CI can\u2019t understand
      why that\u2019s so important to you. I\u2019m happy, Mom. Isn\u2019t that enough?\u201D 
      \u201CLook, Katherine \u2014 all I\u2019m saying is you should think about
      your future. I know you love your work. I love your work too. Cetaceans \u2014
      whales \u2014 are my favorite animal. You remember we used to look at that
      whale book I picked up from the bookstore when you were young? And we each
      picked our favorite whale? And my favorite whale was \u2014\u201D  \u201CThe
      gray whale, because you went whale-watching on the happiest day of your life,
      which was the day you found out you were pregnant with me, which I\u2019ve
      heard so, so many times. I get it.\u201D  \u201CThen you get that at some point,
      you should settle down. Find a husband, raise a family! It\u2019s important
      for a woman\u2026you can\u2019t imagine what a wonderful thing it is!\u201D  
      \u201COh, because it worked out so well for you. Dad left. How the hell do
      you know what I should do?\u201D Katherine said, shaking with indignance.  
      Katherine\u2019s mother recoiled as though she\u2019d been slapped. \u201CHow
      do I know? Fine, maybe I don\u2019t. But tell me Katherine, how do you know
      what you should do? What are your priorities?\u201D   \u201CMom\u2026\u201D
      Katherine had hesitated, her shaking spilling over into tears. \u201CI don\u2019t
      want a family. I don\u2019t want kids. I don\u2019t want a husband, I don\u2019t\u2026like
      men.\u201D She was whispering by the end of her confession, but her gaze stayed
      on her mother\u2019s face.  It was expressionless. Void. It hardly moved when
      her mother instinctively grasped the studded crucifix around her neck.  \u201CKatherine,
      what?\u201D  \u201CI said I don\u2019t like men.\u201D  On the kitchen wall
      behind where they sat, an old clock ticked. Katherine\u2019s mother stood,
      her chair scraping across the tile.  \u201CI need a minute,\u201D she said,
      picking up her car keys from the counter. \u201CI\u2019ll be back sweetheart,
      I just need to process this. I \u2014\u201D she hesitated, her habitual \u2018I
      love you\u2019 on the tip of her tongue. \u201CI\u2019ll be back in a bit,\u201D
      is what she settled for instead.  She never made it back. She had been driving
      for hours. It was a foggy night, and she lived in rural Washington. She rounded
      a bend when a doe slipped out from the heavy woods lining the road with her
      fawn by her side. They froze in the headlights; Katherine\u2019s mother veered
      to miss them, running herself into a ditch, rolling the car and crushing its
      canopy into her skull. In her lap, dripping with blood, was a men\u2019s cowboy
      hat she\u2019d picked up at a truck stop during her drive.   Katherine never
      knew what had caused her mother to drive off the road before \u2014 she was
      standing on the side of the road, watching this memory play out. It was real:
      the mist sifting through yellow shafts of light cast by the overturned car,
      deer bleating somewhere in the woods behind her, the doe and calf looking curiously
      at the carnage in the ditch below. But there was something else, a presence
      behind her, just out of sight. The humanoid creature with the claw. She tried
      to turn, but couldn\u2019t. She was frozen, forced to watch the scene of her
      mother\u2019s death.   \u201CWhy are you showing me this?\u201D she asked,
      her voice trembling.  \u201CYou needed to see it.\u201D  Katherine buckled
      to her knees, her body shaking uncontrollably. \u201CWhat the fuck is going
      on? This can\u2019t be real, can\u2019t be\u2026\u201D The ground beneath her
      began to swirl, contort, roll like endless waves. She sank into the earth,
      and again was aware of being deeply, truly alone. Surrounding her this time
      was infinite darkness. She held herself, shuddering, and words spilled out
      of her mouth:  \u201CIt was my fault. If I hadn\u2019t told her, she wouldn\u2019t
      have left, this wouldn\u2019t have happened. It was my fault!\u201D She cried
      there, alone, for what felt like an eternity. In the space between tears, she
      began to recollect, recompare: deep down, she\u2019d always wondered if her
      mother had done it on purpose. Or if God was punishing her, had killed her
      mother as punishment.   But in the end, it was just chance. One echelon encountering
      another; the shared motherly instinct ensuring the child always survives. 
      In the distance, something glimmered. It was the being again, this time presenting
      as the only light in that endless darkness. It began to move closer. Again,
      everything in Katherine\u2019s mind screamed that she should be terrified,
      but all she could feel was space, warmth, and something else now \u2014 something
      like love.   \u201CWhat are you?\u201D she asked.  \u201CFor every one of you,
      there is one of us,\u201D the being meted out, moving still closer. \u201CWe
      have a duty to each of you. We are you, and you are us. And for a long, long
      time, we have remained silent, and watched. It was kindest to do so.\u201D 
      Kindest \u2014 yes, that was the spacious warmth Katherine kept feeling. It
      was overwhelming kindness, crushing tenderness, one in which someone could
      reside, forgetting themselves forever.  The being was within arm\u2019s length
      now. Katherine stood, and stared into its face. The silhouette was still that
      of a humanoid crustacean, but as she stared into what should have been its
      face, she began to see her own, as though looking into a mirror.  \u201CAre
      you\u2026me?\u201D  The being inched closer.  \u201CThink of it this way. In
      the same way you must navigate and clean your living space, we must navigate
      and cleanse our spiritual space. Time is just another room for us to clean,
      in the end.\u201D  The being pressed into Katherine, enveloped her, subsumed
      her, and everything became light and warmth.  #    Katherine blinked. She was
      lying in the fetal position on the deck of the ferry, cradling her urn. The
      sun was setting, washing the cloudy horizon in vast shades of violet, rose,
      pink, and gray. She stared at the rolling ocean, azure streaked with threads
      of gold. Around her, all the tourists were curled into the fetal position,
      some shuddering, some crying, most resting peacefully, and all unconscious.
      Next to Katherine lay Melissa, held in echelon by her mother.  Katherine stood,
      and returned to the tarnished railing. On the horizon, a fount of spray appeared
      as she uncapped and tipped the urn, watching her mother\u2019s ashes soften,
      then disappear into the waves."

    name: Emma
    content: "I did it because I liked the way it made me feel.   The transaction
      pleased me even before the idea became a reality.   The see-saw of our friendship
      now tipped in my favour- I the one swinging her legs loftily, gripping the
      handles with sweaty palms. Looking down on her smiling face as she crouched
      uncomfortably, waiting for her turn to rise.    I did it because 23 years of
      knowing and loving Emma had taught me that she was regarded as the kinder and
      uncompromising one, she the one who went the extra mile, she the one to outdo
      me with birthday surprises, gifts, encouragement. And even when I tried to
      balance the scales it just somehow didn\u2019t land in the way I wanted. Like
      the time I got her a pricey bottle of wine I could have sworn she'd mentioned,
      only to remember weeks later that Malbec wasn\u2019t her favourite. She drank
      it anyway.   Or the time I got us both tickets for the sky garden and completely
      forgot she wasn't a huge fan of heights. I took my brother instead.   She had
      sat with me through long evenings, as I moaned about work, my lovely but predictable
      husband Alasdair, or our two tweens (her godchildren) and their personal dramas.
      I occasionally managed to return the favour and assumed the same posture for
      her as she shared her heartache at yet another broken relationship, another
      hope deferred, another wasted chapter.   She would come round to mine after
      work, help me clear the kitchen, chat for a bit with whichever child of mine
      would reciprocate. Then we would sit, drink, and laugh \u201C always bloody
      laughing those two\u201D as my Dad used to say of us. But more and more, the
      laughs turned to tears from Emma. The wretched admission of loneliness, the
      restless longing for motherhood.   I would find her gazing blankly at our walls
      studded with family portraits.   Our collective joy recklessly goading her.  
      I loved her and in between the chaos of my life I longed to be better, do better,
      for her.   The idea to save Emma would begin as a germ- something I conceived
      following a radio interview, then after that, a magazine article.   Two grinning
      faces, a baby in arms. A cameo of sacrificial love. I sent a link to Emma one
      sunny afternoon- I remember loitering over the send button for a good while.
      She called back within the hour, her voice swelling with emotion- great sobs
      flowing through the lines to me. I felt the waves of gratitude, I made jokes
      about Alasdair's DNA and was she completely sure she wanted it?! I cried with
      her, made sure she could tell I was crying too, sharing it with her.   Made
      sure she knew my arms were open and this gift, his gift, was hers for the taking.  
      And what would be would be. We would take it step by step, approach the altar
      together, humble ourselves before the gods and wait with baited breath to see
      if they were pleased with our offering.    Then came the hurdles. Research
      (I made a file). Speaking with a clinician. Understanding our rights. I even
      called a lawyer friend.   Alasdair was unsure to begin with but noticeably
      did not fly off the handle. There was a chink,I could sense it. I started showering
      him with online testimonials, a book on the basics.    We watched a movie which
      was strikingly relatable; it made us cry. And he started to get on board. He
      was always more altruistic than me, and I had to admit that his growing compassion
      for Emma and his determination to help was actually really attractive to me.  
      But really the final nail in the coffin was going round for dinner at hers,
      just the three of us.   She cooked Alasdair\u2019s favourite lamb Tagine, and
      had really gone to town. Right down to little bowls of pomegranate seeds, flatbread,
      his favourite lager. Looking back, she had even gone to town on herself, she
      looked more radiant, more composed- better than I'd seen her for months.  
      The grief of her singleness had been slowly desiccating her and she\u2019d
      kind of started looking older (though I never would have said it to her) she
      had even been favouring more comfortable, dated clothes that hung off her.
      Shroud like. But that night was different- she had clearly gone out to get
      new clothes, had her hair and nails done. She looked good , but more than that,
      her face carried something beautiful and bright and it was hard to not keep
      staring at her.   We ate, ate more again, crept the conversation around the
      elephant in the room, and got through more drink than was good for us. Dessert
      came and went (again, Al\u2019s favourite). By the time the coffee came out,
      which none of us really needed, we were cackling with laughter about some stupid
      anecdote- one of Alasdair's colleagues was close to getting fired for his absolute
      lack of social skills. The evening itself closed in around us and we were left
      with the inevitable.   I had chosen to sit next to Emma so she wouldn't feel
      spare, out of habit, but it afforded me the chance to watch Al as she started
      breaking down, her words rushing out along with the years of longing.   As
      she spoke I couldn't help but be moved, and was prompted often to rub her back,
      her hand, her tears provoking my own. It was a familiar scene, one hunched
      in sorrow unbothered now by appearances and the other in a position of quiet
      giving, of comfort and empathy and tissues and tea. So it was interesting to
      me to finally observe Alasdair's reactions. He was clearly moved and his eyes
      never left her lovely face. The only times he locked eyes with me I could feel
      him saying \u201Cnow I understand\u201D.  By the time it was midnight, we had
      all three of us come to a decision.   Emma waved us off at the door after long
      goodbyes, eyes still wet, her whole person shimmering with hope and maybe a
      touch of fear.   Alasdair and I walked home, and through the talk between us
      I could feel his brimming sense of achievement, his sense of wonder. He had
      deposited so much faith with his words alone, with a single promise. He was
      at times,I could see in the lamp light, actually smiling. I knew as only a
      wife could know, that he was charged- illuminated- by the power of his gift.
      And more than that, that he'd been touched by her brokenness, had noticed her
      new beauty.   For myself, I was quiet mostly. Taking it all in. I felt justifiably
      full in so many ways! I was experiencing that gorgeous elevation- my idea,
      my faith, my sacrificial gift. I hoped Al might notice my own illumination.  
      And so it began.  The initial donation was almost as easy as the promise. A
      clinic visit, more paperwork. A small tube passed from hand to locker to hand.
      A small tube with the world inside it, though to a passerby just off-white
      gloop.   I was with Em when his message pinged her.   \u201C Job done! You're
      going to be an AMAZING mum x\u201D  She hadn't cried or anything but we had
      celebrated lunch out. The message kept pinging in my own mind through lunch
      and that afternoon. He never used Capslock in messages! He must have sweated
      over what to say. The kiss at the end. That tiny black cross pinched my nerves
      somewhat.  35 letters, one kiss, a train departed.   I was standing on a platform
      at the station when I had the first vision, as I came to call them.    A scene
      of loveliness- Emma crouching, a full skirt billowed at her ankles, an expression
      of broad contentment on her face. Her eyes locked in love and wonder at the
      toddler staggering towards her open arms. And behind them both, a sanguine
      figure, one hand on hip, his own face mirroring hers- a perfect image of lost
      and found.   I could feel those vibrations coming long before news came to
      us (and of course we were the first to know).  I had hoped the news would break
      these mirages that stopped me in my tracks, but in reality, they didn't. The
      day we heard was the day the match struck the box- the tiny flame eager to
      swallow something whole.   We had gone round with flowers- the best kind, the
      massive, overwhelming kind. Even the girls came and there were tears then too.
      I did well, in retrospect- I still felt good mostly and wanted to feel her
      gratitude flow over me again. And it was there- but I noticed it flowed mainly
      to Alasdair. In small touching gestures, and a shared joke about the child
      growing up to be an accountant like him.   I saw her less from then on. Life
      was.. Well, life. And she now had so much to do, rest and wellbeing her main
      priorities. We messaged, she called once, twice maybe but I was too knackered
      to talk.   Emma on instagram, holding a lightbox sign she\u2019d borrowed from
      my daughter   \u201Cmama to be! Due date 08/10/22\u201D   God, the comments
      from people though. I couldn't take it! Some close to her knew her secret-
      most didn't. We'd all decided on that. Something about the growing ladder of
      over the top messages and united happiness caught me by surprise. I was so
      maddened by it that I felt a migraine coming on and went to bed.   Emma on
      facebook, pretty fingers clutching the black and white rectangles of victory.  
      The hardly discernible images- figures suspended in space, a sloped forehead,
      a raised knee.  A small sucked thumb.   And she was thankful, so very thankful.
      She wrote Al a letter telling him how thankful.   I had to make him share it
      with me. I went into his office at home one day and found the letter, back
      in its envelope, carefully propped on a shelf. And he wasn't one for keeping
      detritus.   I worked hard from then on, even rehearsing conversations- interactions
      I knew were coming up with not only Emma but everyone else. The baby shower,
      or organising a small rota for food drop offs once the baby made an appearance.
      Making sure I kept the baby scan photo on the fridge.   I noticed now, the
      lingering gazes that came from those who knew. Their own faces and questions
      betraying \u2018concerns\u2019 over how I was really (really) finding it all.
      I felt like a pioneer, the first of all our circle, riding out alone into unknown
      territory. And I always felt I should be reporting back more somehow. Communicating
      to them the shock of the new found terrain. Confess to them the discovery that
      something horrid had shifted and shat all over the sparkling vista I had been
      dreaming of reaching. But I was good at funny. So I stuck to that and for a
      while I think it worked.   One morning we woke up to such heavy rain I asked
      Al for a lift to work, but he hesitated and said he couldn't today. Naturally
      I sniffed a fib and needled him until he snapped back that Emma had asked for
      a lift to an appointment. I shocked myself with the heat of my reply and registered
      the alarm on Al's face. I still don't quite remember what bitter words passed
      between us then but I had opened the latch inside me and I can't deny it didn't
      feel good. He even swore at me before leaving which was unthinkable- I was
      glad the girls were still asleep. Me, standing in the hallway in my dressing
      gown, the force of the slammed door still in my bones.   \u201CRemember! this
      was your idea in the first place!\u201D his exit lines, shunting through my
      veins.   When I came home again much later, I scrolled through photos of my
      girls as my dinner spun in the microwave. I watched the years roll back, the
      endless moments. My two creations, getting smaller, smaller, smallest.   Another
      vision, one day while brushing something off my daughters neck. Catching her
      green, lovely eyes. A child looked back at me, eyes alike. A child asking questions.
      It shuddered through me leaving an oil slick of dread in its wake.   Autumn
      came with a sigh, forcing its way into everything. Damp mornings, mouldy leaves
      in the hallway, stuck to shoes.   Autumn came and so did the contractions.  
      Emma messaged me, saying she was excited but scared. The kind of message most
      mothers send when their entire universe is about to push its way through their
      helpless, marvellous body. She had her own mother staying with her now. I got
      the message when I was doing the weekly shop and I stopped a moment to stare
      at the screen. I put the phone back in my bag, finished my shop. Then I sat
      in the car and just bawled like an actual baby. I cried so hard I got a cramp
      in my stomach which forced me to do some deep breathing. I thought of Emma,
      I thought of my own babies. The pain passed.   I had seen her actually, a couple
      of months before. I generously offered help when she told me she still needed
      some bits.   She had slowly lowered herself into the car saying \u201C thanks
      so much for this, I'm definitely getting that nesting urge now!\u201D  \u201CYou
      mean nesting fever,\u201D I replied.  \u201C Oh! Right! Yeah that !.... I\u2019ve
      actually been thinking I might look at some of those co-sleeping pod crib thingies-
      do you know the ones?\u201D  \u201C co- sleeping?! God no- you don't want to
      do that, unless you want a dead baby!\u201D  It had just come out- I'd said
      it with an accent so there's a chance she thought I was trying to be funny
      but it hung in the air like a stink. I don't know what was said after that.
      I was really shaken up with how I didn't care much if I hurt her. I felt a
      strange sense of liveliness, a chill tonic in me.  I don't know how but we
      both managed to shop for and find a crib. She went for something old fashioned
      in the end, said it reminded her of her granny or something like that.   I
      was at the till with her when I found myself staring at the back of her head,
      her hair scraped into a dirty bun. Noticed the old eczema patches had returned
      back at her nape. Stress I said to myself.   She was scrabbling in her bag
      for the right card, softly cursing. And then suddenly out of nowhere I just
      felt this tsunami wave of longing for her- for things to not have changed..for
      our younger uncomplicated selves. \u201CAlways bloody laughing these two\u201D. 
      I leant over, explained to the cashier I would be paying (despite her protests),
      and tapped my card with a dramatic flourish. A flourish to  make the point
      that I wanted to. To demonstrate something that only two best friends could
      translate - I messed up, I'm here for you now.   I\u2019ll get this.   We drive
      past a playground on the way home, I find myself telling her she\u2019s doing
      so, so well.   I think she hears my apology. I put on the radio and we both
      start humming along.   As I glance towards the park I notice two children on
      a see saw, one lifted high with legs akimbo, squealing with delight.   And
      the other crouched with knees bent low, feet in the sand, ready to launch. "

    name: Do Flamethrowers Belong In The Library?
    content: "We lose people all the time. It\u2019s just the nature of the job.
      What can you expect from a place full of nooks and crannies people intentionally
      go to get lost in?  I usually don\u2019t worry when I don\u2019t see someone
      for a while, but when it\u2019s been days since someone\u2019s checked out,
      it\u2019s usually a sign that I need to step in.  I\u2019m not doing this alone,
      thankfully. No Librarian is ever truly alone, are they?  I have help from the
      Watchers and Listeners of the shelves. Thanks to them, it usually doesn\u2019t
      take long to get the scent, if you know what I mean. However, today is one
      of the rare, and unfortunate, exceptions when my search has exceeded more than
      an hour\u2014and an hour is pushing it.  I\u2019ve been searching and asking
      around for almost six hours, scouring shelves and listening for the telltale
      breathing.  The Watchers have their quadrants, so it\u2019s much like playing
      hot and cold.  \u201CBad news.\u201D One says, and my brain shivers in my skull,
      both from its existence and its statement.   \u201CThey crossed the tape.\u201D
      Says the Watcher, and I groan. \u201CAre you sure?\u201D My stomach still drops
      at the thought, even though I\u2019ve been doing this a very long time (long
      enough that I remember every book on every shelf better than my own child\u2019s
      face), but knowing a poor soul lost themselves beyond the tape\u2026 I grieve
      for them.    The Watcher doesn\u2019t speak, but generates an affirmative sensation.
      That means I have to backtrack to my desk for supplies. I thank them, asking
      that they send word ahead of my arrival.  It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve
      had to go past the tape, which means it\u2019s been a while since I entered
      the broom closet. The helmet is dusty (it looks almost like it\u2019s from
      one of those old-fashioned scuba diving suits. It\u2019s not nearly so heavy,
      though.)  There\u2019s a bright lamp affixed to the front just above the visor,
      but it\u2019s as much of a hindrance as a help. While, most of the time, those
      beyond the tape know not to bother me, some still get bored enough to try\u2014and
      the lamp acts like a beacon. I don\u2019t blame them, it\u2019s what prisoners
      do. Find the weakest among them and test their mettle.  I\u2019ve got a sack
      full of non-perishables, tinctures, aspirin, and a compass (not like the kind
      you\u2019re used to, but would take too long to explain\u2014and time is of
      the essence, so I\u2019ll let your imagination handle it from here.)   I sling
      the sack across my body, and fasten my waist with a utility belt that would
      make a trust fund bat character with abandonment issues jealous. It\u2019s
      got floss, lighters, matches, and a few more tools that don\u2019t exist outside
      of The Library.   The last thing I grab is the flamethrower.  This is where
      I should be very transparent with you. I\u2019m not actually the Librarian.
      I\u2019m the Librarian\u2019s Assistant. I know, isn\u2019t that just your
      luck, right?  Not to worry, I\u2019m very good at using this thing, and it
      does the job nicely\u2014whatever job I may deem necessary at any particular
      moment. But the Head Librarian doesn\u2019t really need much of anything to
      ward off what lingers here.  I don\u2019t know exactly where he is at the moment,
      nor do I want to know. If this were a real pickle I would summon him, but while
      a rare occasion, it\u2019s not unusual in the scope of a thousand years. After
      all, no one comes here without the intention (whether it\u2019s conscious or
      subconscious) to get lost. It\u2019s the nature of this place.  But you know
      that, don\u2019t you?   It\u2019s why you\u2019re here, after all.  It doesn\u2019t
      take me long to find the tape, which is fortuitous. Sometimes it moves around,
      but the Watchers and Listeners kept a beat on it this time so as to direct
      me.  Yes, it is really dark.  Yes, it\u2019s literal tape. Hazard tape, but
      that\u2019s almost like a beacon to the adventurous, isn\u2019t it? I think
      The Library knows that. It\u2019s greedy, but it\u2019s also quite discerning
      in taste.  In some circles that means that I should extend congratulations
      to you\u2026 in others, I offer my sincerest sympathy.  I hear my name and
      ignore it as I crawl through the crisscross of reflective strips.  The tape
      moves not at random, by the way. It genuinely serves as a warning.  Whether
      it\u2019s gatekeeping sections currently under construction, in repair, or
      missing. I try not to, but I think that last one has something to do with where
      the Head Librarian went.  Don\u2019t worry about it, my name is not important.  
      So ineffectual that I\u2019ve forgotten.  I hear my name again as I begrudgingly
      turn on the lamp. Not a lot of help, just enough light to ensure I don\u2019t
      trip over anything, or disturb the shelves.   Many sleep here.  I send off
      a warning shot from the flamethrower. Showing I carry more light than just
      atop my appetizing head. The flash of flames sends things\u2026 slithering.
      But most of those this close to the tape have never been very convicted by
      nature, so I\u2019m not concerned.   There are more Listeners and less Watchers
      past the tape, for obvious reasons. Thankfully, they say I don\u2019t have
      to go too far. I look down at the telling clicking sound to see rocks rolling.
      Some as big as my foot, and some as small as the tip of my thumb. The smaller
      ones move more easily, but all are rolling as if pulled toward a central point.
      I don\u2019t even need the compass, but I glance down at it one more time before
      stuffing it back into the sack.  While I don\u2019t have to go too far, things
      are\u2026 relative here. Ten steps may be ten thousand. And so even after only
      a few moments of exploring, I feel acute pressure jamming into my temples.
      My heart feels like it\u2019s being squeezed, and my vision blurs. My fingers
      tingle by the time I\u2019m able to shake the aspirin into my mouth.  I chew
      it, ignoring the sound of my name\u2014my true name. The one only I can hear.
      You\u2019ll hear your own as well, if you stay here long enough.  My vision
      clears, which just means the dark looks sharper, and I sweep another warning
      arc from the flame thrower for good measure.   I do this as much because I
      love the sound as for protection. I also appreciate the warmth. It gets cold
      here. But in a strange way, which shouldn\u2019t surprise you at this point.  
      It\u2019s cold like how the first signs of spring show in the early morning
      dew that\u2019s only just melted. I can smell and taste the sweat on my upper
      lip. And it\u2019s cold.  And then I hear it.   A few or a thousand steps later.  
      The breathing sound I\u2019ve been listening for.  The pace of the rocks quickens,
      and my head is turned down so the helmet light prevents me from tripping over\u2014or
      impeding\u2014their journey.  A famous author once said \u201CAll things serve
      the beam\u201D, and that\u2019s as true in this world as it is in the others.
      Except this beam\u2014this beacon\u2014is attached to our lost visitor.  I
      can only hear the rocks, mumblings, and the breathing sound now. The smell
      is so musty and thick. Like the air is full of sweat and dust. Like I\u2019ve
      stuck my head out the window during a heavily falling rain. If I think hard
      enough about it, soon I\u2019ll be drenched.   So, I don\u2019t.  While the
      rocks are almost the perfect tell, and the Listeners\u2019 too corroborates
      the evidence, you can never be too sure. Only light can be sure.  I take a
      match from the tiny box, snap it to life, and then blow it out. Tiny smoke
      tendrils curl and waft until they also follow the same flow as the rocks. 
      Excellent, we\u2019ve not been led astray.  A few or a thousand more steps,
      and the rocks are gathering down an aisle where the breathing is more like
      wheezing\u2014like the desperate struggle to take in.  Lo and behold, we found
      them!  Poor thing, judging by the state of her, she got lost early. She\u2019s
      likely been here for most of the day. The book covers her face\u2014consuming
      her head like a kid on a particularly large popsicle. The pages flutter gently
      against her too-white jaw.   The papery quality of her skin, and the wanting
      muscle mass, show how little time was on our side\u2014not a moment to waste. 
      I grab the book by the edges of both back and front covers, it\u2019s got most
      of her head inside at this point, just her earlobes, hair, and edge of her
      jaw peak out from beneath the pages I now grip firmly. The wheezing turns into
      a moan that turns into a sob.  \u201CNow, now.\u201D I say, and test the hold
      the book has on its victim. It\u2019s snug, too snug to yank like a leech.
      I need to treat it like a tick, making sure to get the head out.  None of these
      are intended as puns, but it just happens after being surrounded by books and
      pros for so long.  I draw one of the tiny viles strapped in my utility belt
      and pull the cork out. It smells like nothing to me, but I see the reaction
      immediately. Our half-consumed explorer moves a bit, her fingers mostly, and
      I hear a second, tinier moan beneath that of the book\u2019s. I pour a small
      amount of the substance into the palm of my hand, and I smooth it gently down
      the spine of the book. It wails again, and so does the girl, both full of sorrow
      and reluctance.   I feel the hairs on the back of my neck stand up, so I turn
      at the hip, cock the flamethrower, and send off a very intentionally long tail
      of flames. When the feeling subsides, I shrug the weapon back over my shoulder. 
      I use the backs of two knuckles to knock gently on the book cover, \u201CIt\u2019s
      time to come back now. My apologies.\u201D I say, and I mean it. The book and
      the girl moan again, more hollowly, and I can feel the seal\u2014the bond\u2014splitting
      like a seam. I grip the book again, because these two are stubborn, and have
      to pry them apart. The color and mass return beneath her skin, and though her
      eyes are open, they can\u2019t see anything. She\u2019ll be like that for a
      while, it\u2019s normal. She\u2019ll recover.  I pour the remaining contents
      of the bottle down the part of her frazzled blond hair. Tears fill the empty
      eyes and drip down her face. Her mouth presses into a thin white line and grimaces
      so intensely that the flesh folds in multiple layers at the corners of her
      mouth. Great pain.  Even after a thousand years I still can\u2019t help but
      feel sorry, so I pull her burning head under my chin, and rub circles into
      her back.   \u201CI\u2019m sorry, dear. I know you\u2019ve been told otherwise,
      but this place is a prison, and that isn\u2019t your story. Yours is still
      being written, and the one which made you pretty promises is lying and jealous.  
      \u201COne day you, if the world is cruel, may yet have a place here. But it\u2019s
      not today. So let\u2019s go have a cup of tea.\u201D I tell her, as I\u2019ve
      told many like her. I\u2019ve gotten better at it over the years. I used to
      have to fight with them. Often I\u2019d give up and just keep them safe until
      the Head Librarian got back to talk them down.   She finally lets out a weak,
      wheezing breath. I take advantage of the broken seam of her lips and pour a
      tincture down her throat. I don\u2019t even have to look anymore, I can just
      feel the specific melodies that make each tincture different. It helps that
      the one I need usually sings a bit louder as a courtesy, and it\u2019ll purr
      like a cat when I\u2019ve touched my fingers to it.  She chokes a bit, but
      her eyes start to clear.  Good enough for now.   The back of my neck has another
      sudden influx of goosebumps. We\u2019ve overstayed our welcome. It\u2019s time
      to go.   I put the book back on the shelf. I don\u2019t scold it, just allow
      its ache and frustration flow through me. I apologize, but there\u2019s no
      comfort I can give. My words and compassion are meaningless. I\u2019ve noted
      the volume and will tell the Head Librarian, they might be able to soothe it
      back to sleep.  I tap the metal bauble around my neck, and we\u2019re back
      at my desk.  I drape the girl onto a nearby loveseat that\u2019s seen better
      days, starting the kettle before heading to the broom closet to stash the emergency
      kit.  She\u2019ll be fine. People like her (and you) always are.  This place
      was made to help the wanderers and recklessly imaginative. Those who can\u2019t
      wrap their heads around the world the way it is, and can see the truth of magic
      between heartbeats and heartbreaks.   And people like me, and the Head Librarian
      (when they so choose to grace us with their presence), keep the place orderly
      and open for you\u2026 and we\u2019re here to help guide you back on track
      if you lose inspiration for your own story.  It\u2019s the nature of the job\u2014The
      Library itself.   What else can you expect from a place full of nooks and crannies
      that people choose to get lost in?"

    name: Sight Unseen
    content: "Sight Unseen  Abraham Morgenstern reverently offered Sidra the Radio
      Shack catalog, as if it was his most prized possession.  \u201CThis is the
      new one,\u201D he said. \u201CShall we begin with the CB radios and then move
      on to the antennas? And please, call me Abe.\u201D  Sidra rolled her eyes,
      which fortunately Mr. Morgenstern \u2013 Abe \u2013 could not see, and started
      reading. She was barely through the first line, \u201CRealistic TRC-410. Compact,
      but with all the necessary features. Hysteresis-type squelch\u2026,\u201D when
      noise from the street below drowned her out. Looking out the window, Sidra
      saw people at the bus stop cheering as a woman wearing a feather boa screamed
      \u201Cno money, no honey\u201D over and over to some guy honking his puke yellow
      Mustang.  Abe seemed oblivious to the noise. And the heat, thought Sidra, as
      she wiped her face with the hem of her t-shirt. It had been particularly gross
      climbing the stairs to his room today. It was unusually hot for San Francisco
      and, with a dead rat in the stairwell and urine-soaked carpet in the hall,
      the Hotel Leo was even more disgusting than usual. Despite its supposed elegance
      in the early 1900s, it was now the Tenderloin\u2019s most rundown flophouse.
      A fan in Abe\u2019s room would help, but he\u2019d told her fans interfered
      with radio waves. Go figure.  \u201CPlease continue Sidra, perhaps with more
      zest?\u201D  She made a face. Zest? She didn\u2019t do zest. But if that\u2019s
      what the old man wanted: \u201CBig LED channel readout! An LED S/RF meter!
      Auto-modulation circuit! Ceramic filters!\u201D  Abe clapped his hands with
      pleasure. \u201CMagnificent!\u201D  * * *  The police had arrested Sidra a
      few months earlier for shoplifting a necklace. She\u2019d had enough money
      to buy it, but stupidly wanted to see if she still had skills. It was her first
      offense as an adult, so the judge sentenced her to community service and a
      social services agency assigned her to read each week to blind Abe. As community
      service gigs go, it had sounded great. Way better than picking up trash, right?
      Not exactly.  On their first Saturday together, she thought Abe wanted to order
      something when he handed her a Radio Shack catalog. Instead, he politely asked
      her to read every single word in its 176 pages. For three solid hours she dutifully
      read each digit, acronym, and megahertz, but she only got up to page 99, coaxial
      connectors \u2013 whatever those were. She finished that catalog last week,
      and Sidra hoped that today she\u2019d get to read a book or newspaper to him.
      But nope, he had handed her the new Summer 1981 Radio Shack catalog.  Sidra
      found Abe pleasant enough, but a bit puzzling. He only talked about radio stuff
      and there was nothing interesting in his room \u2013 two chairs, a bed, a dresser
      with a bunch of radios and antennas on top, and a hot plate. No photos of relatives
      or anything else with clues to his background. Sidra didn\u2019t like people
      she couldn\u2019t get a quick read on. Her superpower was staying one step
      ahead of everyone.  She glanced at Abe. His face lit up when she read certain
      descriptions in the catalog. It was peculiar, but she didn\u2019t care enough
      to ask why. Still, no harm in humoring him.  \u201CThe priority switch gives
      INSTANT, DIRECT access to either Channel 9 or Channel 19!\u201D She added a
      \u201CWOW!\u201D for good measure.  Abe glowed.  \u201CA priority switch? Oh
      my, that is spectacular!\u201D  Sidra couldn\u2019t help herself \u2013 she
      giggled. What a thing, she thought, to be part of this man\u2019s absolute,
      inexplicable joy.  *  *  *  A few weeks later, after reading about the six-band
      Realist DX-60 for the third time, curiosity got the best of her.  \u201CAbe,
      what exactly is a shortwave radio?\u201D  \u201CIt is simply a radio frequency,
      like AM and FM. Shortwave can travel farther though, which means I can listen
      to broadcasts from all over the world.\u201D  He continued, excited by her
      interest. \u201CRadio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation, projected
      in different directions by antennas. Those in the shortwave band are reflected
      from the ionosphere \u2013 a layer of electrically charged atoms in the atmosphere.
      By tuning my receivers to specific frequencies, I can collect certain signals.
      It is quite something!\u201D  It was the most Abe had spoken to Sidra since
      she\u2019d started reading to him. Unfortunately, she didn\u2019t understand
      what he was saying.  \u201CThe radio waves are reflected from outer space?\u201D 
      \u201CYes, that is it!\u201D Abe said. \u201CAlthough there are other ways
      to receive electromagnetic waves too.\u201D  \u201CSuch as?\u201D  \u201CThrough
      your teeth. Just like Lucille Ball. One time she was on TV and announced that
      during World War II she had picked up radio broadcasts through her fillings.\u201D 
      Abe leaned forward and whispered conspiratorially, \u201CYou should know that
      I, too, have communicated with other beings through my fillings.\u201D  Good
      lord, Sidra thought. That\u2019s what I get for asking questions. She did not
      want to know if he talked to little green men with his teeth. Time to wrap
      things up.  \u201CHow about if we finish this page and that\u2019ll be it for
      today?\u201D      \u201CActually, I was hoping when we finished that you would
      join me for lunch,\u201D Abe said. \u201CIf you have time.\u201D  Sidra was
      taken aback by the invitation. But she was hungry.  \u201CSure, um, I guess
      so,\u201D she said, hoping there\u2019d be no more mention of outer space.
      \u201CThanks.\u201D  \u201CExcellent! If you could get my cane from under the
      bed, I\u2019ll excuse myself and then we will go. \u201D      Abe amused Sidra
      with his more formal manner of speaking \u2013 \u201Cexcusing himself\u201D
      meant using the restroom down the hall. She reached under the bed for his long
      white cane and saw a shoebox. Curious, she pulled it out. There were hundreds
      of tiny pieces of paper inside. Fortunes \u2013 from fortune cookies. What
      an odd thing to save. Underneath all the paper was a thick envelope and a rectangular
      case covered in dark blue velvet. Hearing Abe\u2019s footsteps, she hastily
      grabbed the envelope and one of the fortunes, slid the shoebox back under the
      bed, and picked up his cane.  Abe opened the door and tilted his head.  \u201CSomething
      is askew.\u201D  \u201CI closed your window,\u201D she said.  \u201CThank you,\u201D
      said Abe. But he looked pensive.  *  *  *  Abe held Sidra\u2019s elbow while
      navigating their way out of the Hotel Leo, tip-tapping back and forth with
      his cane. She was amazed how many people greeted him, and how he recognized
      everyone\u2019s voices \u2013 \u201CArnie, good afternoon to you,\u201D to
      the hotel manager sitting in his usual haze of cigarette smoke. \u201CLovely
      song Marcus,\u201D to the annoying man with the boombox on the front steps.
      \u201CJade, how are you feeling this week?\u201D to the woman running the newsstand. 
      At the corner, they turned left and came to Happy Delight, a small Chinese
      restaurant she\u2019d never noticed. The place was shabby, with chipped Formica
      tables and torn leather booths, but it smelled wonderful. An elderly woman
      hurried over as soon as they walked in, bowed, and patted Abe\u2019s arm affectionately. 
      \u201CHello Mr. Morgenstern. You brought a friend!\u201D  \u201CGood day, Mrs.
      Huang. Yes, this is Sidra. I want her to try your remarkable lo mein.\u201D 
      By the time they sat down, Mrs. Huang was already back with two heaping bowls
      of chicken lo mein. Rejecting the chopsticks, which she had no idea how to
      use, Sidra took a generous forkful of noodles. She wasn\u2019t big on Chinese
      food, but she\u2019d try to get it down.  \u201COh my god! Abe, this is delicious!\u201D
      she exclaimed. Seriously, it was incredible.      \u201CThat it is. I come
      to Happy Delight every Saturday for Mrs. Huang\u2019s lo mein,\u201D Abe said.
      \u201CChew slowly, so you can taste all the flavors and textures. Paying close
      attention changes everything.\u201D      \u201CSure thing Yoda,\u201D Sidra
      said.      \u201CYodel?\u201D      \u201CYoda. Y-o-d-a. You know, from Star
      Wars? The Empire Strikes Back? Yoda\u2019s a wrinkly little wise teacher.\u201D      
      \u201CIt is similar to the Hebrew word \u2018Yodea\u2019 \u2013 one who knows.
      But Sidra, you do not need a Yoda. Everything you need to know is already inside
      you.\u201D  \u201CAnd that\u2019s why you sound like Yoda!\u201D she said. 
      When they finished their meal, Mrs. Huang brought two fortune cookies to the
      table. Abe asked to Sidra read hers aloud. She did so, while shaking her head
      at the irony: \u201CTo believe in the unseen is both a triumph and a blessing.\u201D 
      *  *  *  That evening, back in her apartment, Sidra taped her Happy Delight
      fortune in a notebook and began to write about how ridiculous it was to believe
      in things you couldn\u2019t see. Then she remembered the fortune from Abe\u2019s
      shoebox \u2013 he would never miss it \u2013 and pulled it out of her pocket:
      \u201CBe kind always. You never know what someone is going through.\u201D She
      taped it to another page and wrote \u201Ckindness is overrated.\u201D  She
      hoped the contents of Abe\u2019s envelope would be more interesting, but it
      was just a bunch of faded newspaper articles about the Holocaust and some hospital.
      She skimmed the clippings. Depressing, but not anything about Abe. Then two
      headlines caught her eye: \u201CHolocaust Survivors Have Own Wing at Insane
      Asylum\u201D and \u201CJews Attacked at Mental Hospital: 4 Die, 11 Hurt, 3
      Blinded.\u201D The last article said all \u201Cthe lunatics\u201D were \u201Cresettled\u201D
      in San Francisco.  Was Abe a Holocaust survivor? Had he been in that mental
      health place? Sidra wished she hadn\u2019t poked around in his belongings.
      His life wasn\u2019t her business. She needed to do her community service stint
      and be done with him. The articles didn\u2019t change anything. Or maybe they
      changed everything.  *   *   *  Happy Delight became part of their Saturday
      schedule and eventually Sidra asked Abe why he liked Radio Shack catalogs so
      much. Without hesitation, he said the numbers were soothing, like a mantra
      \u2013 though admittedly an unconventional one. He also said the radios were
      more than electronics. They were connections.  He told her stories about the
      things he learned and people he met through his radios. On his CB, he talked
      every day to truckers all over the U.S. and Canada. His favorite driver called
      himself Charlie Tuna. He\u2019d been driving a big rig since he got out of
      San Quentin and gave Abe weekly updates on his travels. Using the shortwave
      radio, Abe heard broadcasts from all over the world, telling Sidra about labor
      strikes in Paris and Queen Elizabeth\u2019s birthday parade. She learned \u201Cham
      radio\u201D was slang for Amateur Radio, and not something involving pork,
      and that he used it to talk to people in Morocco and Brazil. Abe\u2019s stories
      reminded her of Arabian Nights, where Scheherazade told the king a different
      story every night to stay alive. She\u2019d read that book over and over in
      middle school, trying to escape the miserable reality of Foster Family #3.
      Like Scheherazade, the stories had kept her alive.  Each Saturday night, Sidra
      taped a new fortune in her notebook. The day her fortune said, \u201CYour dreams
      are only your dreams until you write them down \u2013 then they\u2019re goals,\u201D
      she started writing about what each fortune made her think about. There was
      always some truth, some nugget of wisdom to extract. After getting \u201CThe
      world is a book, and those who do not travel read only a page,\u201D she wrote
      about all the places she wanted to go. When her fortune said, \u201CAn investment
      in knowledge pays the best interest,\u201D she wrote a long list of things
      she wanted to learn about and sent away for college catalogs. \u201CDon\u2019t
      wait for anyone else to light your fire: you have your own matches,\u201D was
      the incentive she needed to ask for a raise at her waitressing job.  Sidra
      found herself smiling more. And talking to people she had previously ignored.
      It certainly improved her tips! But it wasn\u2019t about the money. It was
      for the stories. They gave her an unexpected, totally unfamiliar, sense of
      something. She didn\u2019t have a good word for it. It just felt good. Like
      last week, when she\u2019d sat down with James, who was always in the hotel
      lobby with his mangy cat. It was like she\u2019d handed him a hundred bucks
      instead of merely saying hello. He enthusiastically invited her to pet the
      cat \u2013 introduced as Bubbles \u2013 and, while scratching its ears (and
      praying it didn\u2019t have fleas), he told her wild tales about when he worked
      on a fishing boat in Alaska.  She was enjoying Saturdays with Abe. Last week,
      as they ate at Happy Delight, Sidra had asked him why he had so many kinds
      of antennas.     \u201COh yes,\u201D said Abe, \u201CI have been meaning to
      tell you about them. The antennas connect me beyond our earth and our solar
      system, to other galaxies. With the right antenna, I can communicate with extraterrestrial
      beings.\u201D      Sidra sighed \u2013 louder than she had intended.  \u201CYou
      are skeptical Sidra,\u201D Abe said. \u201CBut I assure you, we\u2019re not
      alone. We are not alone in the universe. We share it with many other life forms.\u201D
      He paused. \u201CYou think believing that makes me weird, don\u2019t you?\u201D     
      \u201CI didn\u2019t say that.\u201D  \u201CAh, but I can hear your face,\u201D
      he said. Then he chuckled. \u201CThat is fine. As I recall it was Dr. Seuss
      who said we are all a bit weird.\u201D  As she finished her lo mein, Sidra
      pondered all that she was learning \u2013 from fortune cookies, Dr. Suess,
      a trucker named Charlie Tuna, and a blind man who believed in space aliens.
      She broke open her cookie and had to laugh: \u201CDo not be afraid to learn
      from everything and everyone.\u201D Of course.  *  *  *  Today Abe seemed agitated.
      He kept interrupting Sidra, asking her to start over.  \u201CWhat\u2019s up
      with you?\u201D she finally asked, putting the Radio Shack catalog down.  \u201CI
      am worried,\u201D he said. \u201CThe solar eclipse is next week, and Jesse
      went to visit his daughter in Sacramento.\u201D  \u201CWho\u2019s Jesse?\u201D 
      \u201CHe lives down the hall. Without Jesse I do not know what to do,\u201D
      Abe said. \u201CHe takes me to the park for each eclipse. We put on our hats
      and then, when the sun and the moon collide, Jesse\u2019s eyes become mine.\u201D 
      Well, that sounded bizarre, even for Abe. He put his head in his hands, looking
      miserable.  \u201CWhat day is the eclipse?\u201D Sidra asked.  \u201CFriday.\u201D 
      \u201CI have the day off from the restaurant, so I can walk you to the park
      if you want.\u201D  \u201CYou would have to wear the hat.\u201D  \u201CSure
      Abe, I can wear a hat.\u201D  * *  *  On Friday, Abe met Sidra in the lobby
      with a lumpy helmet on his head made from aluminum foil. He held out a second,
      identical one to her.  \u201CHere you go. I made it yesterday and hope it fits.\u201D 
      \u201CAbe\u2026\u201D  \u201CIt is your hat. You said you would wear the hat.\u201D 
      No way she was putting this pile of tinfoil on her head! But she took it. He\u2019d
      never know if she just carried it.  \u201CFits great,\u201D Sidra said.  Arnie
      banged on the bullet-proof glass and yelled. \u201CAbe, she doesn\u2019t have
      it on!\u201D Then he grinned and gave her two thumbs up.    \u201CSidra, we
      cannot go if you do not wear your hat.\u201D  Well, it was, after all, San
      Francisco. Maybe no one would notice? She put it on.  As they walked, Abe continued
      talking about the helmet. \u201CThe radio waves during an eclipse are intense.
      It is most important to protect your brain\u2026\u201D Then, as if reciting
      scientific fact, added \u201Cotherwise the sun and moon will not have full
      access when our eyes switch. This time I hope to see beyond the stars.\u201D 
      Sidra stopped. \u201CWait, did you say our eyes switch?\u201D  \u201CIt is
      the whole point of the eclipse Sidra. We each put on the glasses and during
      the eclipse, there is a cross-oculisation. I will have your eyes and you will
      have mine.\u201D  \u201CMeaning I\u2019ll be blind?\u201D  \u201COnly for the
      length of the eclipse.\u201D  Okay Abe, she\u2019d play along.  \u201CAnd my
      eyesight will come back?\u201D  \u201CIt will. Jesse\u2019s always does,\u201D
      said Abe. \u201CBut you might see things differently than before.\u201D  * 
      *  *  Dozens of people with cameras and solar eclipse glasses were in the park
      setting up lawn chairs and telescopes. No one looked twice at the old man and
      young woman wearing aluminum foil helmets. Sitting down on an empty bench,
      Abe opened the beautiful velvet case she\u2019d seen in his shoebox, under
      all the fortunes, and pulled out two pairs of exquisite, antique gold eyeglasses
      with amber lenses.  \u201COne pair for you and one for me,\u201D he said. \u201CWith
      these, during the eclipse, that which has been cloaked in darkness will become
      visible.\u201D  *  *  *  When the moon took its first bite of the sun, Abe
      reached for Sidra\u2019s hand.  \u201CThe trees, Sidra!\u201D Abe exclaimed.
      \u201CThe flowers! The fountain! The park is as breathtaking as I remember.
      Now for an opening, so I can peer into the cosmos. \u201D  Sidra couldn\u2019t
      see a thing.  \u201CAbe, this isn\u2019t funny.\u201D  Suddenly Sidra\u2019s
      darkness turned blood red and what looked like human remains rose from the
      dirt and began to wail. What was happening? She screamed. Or thought she screamed.
      Swirling straightjackets surrounded her as shadowy figures called out. She
      had to be hallucinating. Is this what was in Abe\u2019s head? His mind\u2019s
      eye?  It was as if he knew what was happening. He wrapped both his hands around
      her trembling one. \u201CBreathe, dear Sidra\u2026breathe,\u201D he said. \u201CNothing
      you see can hurt you.\u201D  Sidra slowed her breath and as she did, glimmers
      of soft light began to appear and slowly grew bigger and brighter. She felt
      Abe\u2019s energy and kindness flow through her as everything came into focus.
      There was an explosion of light around her. Or inside her? She wasn\u2019t
      sure. But the frightening shadows faded, transforming into kind faces and stories
      and radios.  Sidra wasn\u2019t sure about the whole universe \u2013 but, she
      thought, perhaps on this planet, she was no longer alone."

    name: The Driving Snow
    content: "I tied and untied my Converse in the passenger seat, knees tucked close
      to my chest and sitting very still in the empty Southwest High School parking
      lot. One by one, snowflakes fell from a gray and motionless sky, only to land
      and melt instantly on the windshield, transforming into nothing but a dot of
      clear liquid, almost as if it were raining. It was New Year's Eve, my last
      year of school, and I was miserable.   Suddenly the driver\u2019s side door
      flew open and a burly man holding a clipboard leaned down. The driving instructor.  
      \u201CCosette Evans, right?\u201D he asked, plopping himself into the seat
      before I could answer. The car shook slightly and his cologne filled the interior,
      his stomach brushing the bottom of the steering wheel.   \u201CThat\u2019s
      me,\u201D I replied, letting my shoes slide to the floor. He glanced down at
      his clipboard and back up at me.   \u201CSo,\u201D he said, clearing his throat.
      \u201CYour fourth try?\u201D   \u201CYes.\u201D I pulled my glasses out of
      my pocket.   \u201CWell you probably know the drill then, don\u2019t you?\u201D  
      We swapped places - I meandered around the front of the car and he around the
      back. It was a silver Honda Civic, the kind of car Dad had when I was growing
      up, but a few years newer. For a moment, I placed my finger in the beaded droplets
      that had collected on the hood and spelled my name in them. For good luck maybe,
      but nobody ever said fourth time\u2019s a charm.  \u201CI haven\u2019t got
      all day,\u201D the man grumbled from inside when he saw me dawdling. I wondered
      if he was always this impatient or only with the kids who hadn\u2019t passed
      their exam the first time around.   I climbed into the driver\u2019s seat and
      started the car, placing my hands at ten and two.   \u201CLet\u2019s not waste
      time in the parking lot,\u201D he said. \u201CWe\u2019ll make our way out to
      27th and head downtown before the snow gets any heavier. Big storm coming.\u201D  
      I put the car in drive and inched forward, too afraid of letting my foot leave
      the brake entirely. The snow was dizzying. Through it, I noticed the Shake
      Stop across the road with one of those colored \u201COPEN\u201D signs all lit
      up and blinking, turning the snow that fell in front of it blue then red. Who
      would want to go there in this weather, I thought. Last year Jamie and I took
      Dad there for his birthday; it was the hottest day of the summer.  \u201COne
      Peanut Protein Dream Shake please,\u201D he said confidently to the worker.  
      \u201CPeanut Butter Dream Protein Cream Shake,\u201D I whispered to him, shaking
      my head and snickering with Jamie.   \u201CHow is anybody supposed to remember
      that,\u201D Dad joked as he handed over a twenty. \u201CIt\u2019s like the
      password to a secret club.\u201D The worker laughed. I recognized her from
      school, a year or two below me.  But I remember it so clearly because it was
      the day before his diagnosis. We were sitting on the stones at the edge of
      the strip mall, looking over at the sun setting above Southwest High. I loved
      how it painted the brick walls a bright, dazzling orange. Midsummer was in
      full swing and the cicadas were just beginning to come out from the creek bed
      behind the building.  \u201CYou guys like high school?\u201D Dad asked us.  
      Jamie grinned and rolled her eyes. \u201CIt\u2019s summer break, Dad. Don\u2019t
      do this.\u201D   \u201CI\u2019m just asking,\u201D he exclaimed, taking a sip
      of his shake. \u201CI think you two will love senior year, especially you Cozy.\u201D  
      \u201CWhy\u2019s that?\u201D  \u201CBecause,\u201D he replied, the sun illuminating
      his brown eyes, \u201Cyou\u2019ve always loved a good ending.\u201D   As I
      flicked on the left turn signal at the 27th intersection, staring at the spot
      across the road where he\u2019d said that to me, I was already fighting back
      tears. There wasn\u2019t going to be a good ending. Things had become so different
      so quickly. How was I ever supposed to keep up?  At the light, I was hoping
      for a left arrow, but all I got was a bright green circle. I sniffled and eased
      off the accelerator into the middle of the intersection. Honestly, I hadn\u2019t
      the first clue what yielding meant or when I was allowed to turn.  Driving
      never really clicked for me. It worked out just fine for Jamie. Dad had taught
      her, though. Once she\u2019d learned how to do it, he\u2019d become far too
      sick to stand, so I was left to fend for myself. I took a few lessons on Wednesdays
      after school and even some exams, but I always lacked the confidence to speed
      up or keep both hands on the wheel, all while watching out for other cars.
      It frightened me, like I was a risk to everyone else on the road. I\u2019d
      get distracted, always picturing Mom throwing up in the toilet at three in
      the morning and the unforgettable feeling of Dad\u2019s grip loosening on my
      hand in the hospital.   Somehow I turned safely and began driving north. The
      road was wide and gray, its two lanes empty except for our Civic. I stayed
      in the left lane, cruising a full ten under the speed limit. The instructor
      didn\u2019t seem to mind - he kept saying \u201Cnice and easy\u201D like he
      could sense my nerves. It helped.  I watched the trees, frozen and bare, reflecting
      on the windshield as if they were trying to protect us from the falling snow
      with their wicked branches. The suburbs built in the 70\u2019s blew past in
      a flurry of white and brown. Some people still had their colored lights on,
      even though Christmas was finally over and the world felt worn out, like it\u2019d
      just run a long race - the same one, year after year.   \u201CGot New Year\u2019s
      plans?\u201D the man asked me, tapping on his clipboard with a pencil.  \u201CNot
      really, no.\u201D  \u201CMom and Dad let you go out with friends?\u201D  In
      one quick breath I said, \u201CMy mom\u2019s in a psychiatric hospital and
      my dad died in August.\u201D  I shouldn\u2019t have let it slip out that way.
      I hated how nonchalant I sounded - so disconnected, emotionless, when really
      I was the opposite. I came across so matter-of-fact, but there was no use in
      lying, especially when my parents were all I thought about.  \u201CJesus,\u201D
      he said. I could feel his eyes on me, his sympathy. \u201CI\u2019m really sorry.\u201D 
      I stared straight ahead as we passed under the glow of another green light,
      feeling my face turn sour and my eyes well up. The snow was thickening now
      into wide clumps. I turned on the wipers. How many times had Dad driven me
      down this road himself, me in the rear, kicking the back of his seat to piss
      him off, just so he\u2019d reach behind and tickle my legs? He used to take
      me to the library all summer long, back when my hair was blonde, to the fields
      where I played soccer in first grade, and the sledding hill behind the YMCA
      that no one else knew about except for me and him.   I thought about my best
      friend Kayla and how warm the holidays felt at her house, with its massive
      kitchen island and her kind older brothers and Jack Russell Terrier, how lucky
      I was that she\u2019d invited me and Jamie to sleep over on Christmas Eve.
      We slept in the same bed that night, just like we had when we were young and
      it would thunderstorm, her arms wrapped around me as I sobbed myself to sleep.
      Then I started to wonder why even when we found Mom unconscious in the bathtub
      earlier that month, I still hadn\u2019t seen Jamie cry. Why was she always
      the one who could keep herself together? Why was she the strong one?  \u201CMy
      dad died when I was seventeen,\u201D the man said softly, after a few minutes.  
      \u201COh,\u201D I mumbled. \u201CI\u2019m really sorry too.\u201D   \u201CIt\u2019s
      alright,\u201D he said. A moment later, \u201C I wish I could tell you it goes
      away, but losing a parent never really does. Not completely. Especially when
      it\u2019s sudden. It\u2019ll always feel like a piece of you is missing in
      some way or another.\u201D  I said nothing, feeling a tear slip down my left
      cheek.   \u201CSorry,\u201D he said, turning back to the road. \u201CWe don\u2019t
      have to talk about this. Really, I\u2019m sorry.\u201D   \u201CIt\u2019s okay.\u201D  
      The two of us sat in silence until we crept up on South Boulevard, where the
      city began to get denser, the bungalows a little older but a little nicer.
      We were around the corner from the country club where Jamie and I worked last
      summer. I used to walk around the neighborhood with her on Fridays after we
      finished, waiting for Dad to pick us up and take us for Slurpees at the 7-Eleven
      down the road. He would wink and say, don\u2019t tell your mother.   Before
      she was even seventeen, Jamie had already picked out a house on the corner
      of Sycamore Avenue that she wanted to buy when she got married and bought a
      dog. His name would be Sparky and she\u2019d have two kids, a boy and a girl.
      I could never think about my future like that because I never knew what I wanted.  
      \u201COne day you will,\u201D Dad had told me when we were sitting together
      in the driveway last May. \u201COne morning you\u2019ll wake up and open your
      windows and see the world in a different way and deep down you\u2019ll know
      exactly what you want. You\u2019re still so young, Cozy. And just because Jamie
      thinks she\u2019s got it all figured out doesn\u2019t mean she really does.
      You always think about things too much, but that\u2019s what I like about you.
      You\u2019re so much like I was. Like I still am.\u201D   I felt my voice tremble
      and say to the instructor, \u201CDeath was never something I thought about
      until he died. It wasn\u2019t real, it was never something that could actually
      happen to anyone I know. It was only something they talked about in books or
      at church or on TV, you know? Like car crashes or tornadoes or something. That
      sort of pain seemed so far away from me, so impossible to understand. But now
      I get it.\u201D  \u201CI know exactly what you mean,\u201D he replied as we
      approached another intersection. \u201CTake a right here.\u201D   Through the
      passenger window I saw the old Pizza Hut that got turned into a bank and next
      to it, the empty lots where there used to be a farmer\u2019s market. Mom and
      Dad would take us when we were tiny almost every Sunday morning. I remember
      them swing dancing like fools to the jazz band by fountains. With silly grins
      on their faces they\u2019d whirl around and all the other people would clap
      and dance along with them. Meanwhile Jamie and I would take our shoes and socks
      off and splash under the falling water, soaking our hair and our sundresses
      and giggling because we didn\u2019t have a care in the world. Once we\u2019d
      dried off, Dad would buy us each a Whoopie Pie, a chocolate one for Jamie and
      an oatmeal one for me. It\u2019s funny, thinking about it now, realizing that
      little girl is still me, that I have the same hair but a little darker, the
      same hands but a little bigger, the same smile but a little less crooked. Remembering
      that time felt like looking out from deep inside a cave, from a place where
      the light no longer reached. In my memory, it seemed like the sun shined every
      day back then, and nothing ever felt wrong or sad or complicated or terrifying.  
      \u201CHow did it happen?\u201D I asked him. The wind was picking up and the
      speed limit was forty now, but for some reason I felt this strange sense of
      peace.   \u201CHeart attack,\u201D said the man. \u201COne minute he was grilling
      steaks for my brother and I, the next just\u2026gone, that quick.\u201D   \u201COh
      man.\u201D   \u201CHow about your dad?\u201D  \u201CBrain cancer.\u201D I was
      staring at the road, mesmerized by the snowflakes dancing up the curb and weaving
      through the blades of flat, dead grass on the median. It almost felt like we
      were inside a snow globe.   \u201CJesus. Awful disease.\u201D He sniffled and
      quietly wiped his eyes with a tissue from the glovebox, offering me one in
      the same gesture, but I wasn\u2019t quite crying anymore. After a minute he
      said \u201CYou know, I remember hating it when people would tell me that eventually
      it would get better.\u201D  \u201CYeah. I\u2019m not sure I want it to get
      better,\u201D I said, now coasting at the speed limit. \u201CI just want it
      to be the way it used to, like to turn back time or something and be a kid
      again.\u201D   \u201COh man, we all wish that,\u201D he chuckled. Out of the
      corner of my eye, a kind, genuine smile. \u201CEvery damn one of us.\u201D  
      He had me turn into the entrance of Jameson Park. We\u2019d practice parallel
      parking for a minute, then head back to Southwest High before the snow came
      down in sheets. The lot was completely empty except the shrunken snow pile
      in the corner, sharp with ice chunks and speckled with gravel and dirt. Even
      from across the parking lot I could see the contrast of the fresh powder settling
      over it, pure and white. I wondered if by tomorrow, the old pile would be completely
      invisible, swallowed up by the new snow falling from the sky and blanketing
      the concrete.   \u201CThis is the hardest part though,\u201D said the man. 
      \u201CParallel parking?\u201D  He laughed. \u201CWell yes, that. But I mean
      the first year without him.\u201D   \u201COh, I guess, yeah.\u201D   \u201CIt
      won\u2019t ever go away completely,\u201D he said. \u201CBut you\u2019ll learn
      to live with it, like they\u2019re a part of you. And then eventually you have
      your own kids and realize your parents loved you more than you could ever understand.
      It\u2019s different. But it heals you.\u201D  The man set out four orange cones
      in a rectangle and told me I was supposed to park in between them. With patience,
      he guided my maneuvers. Back for just a few feet, turn to the left and foot
      off the brake. Then ease it to the right and let the car slide in between.
      I could hear the tires crunching the snow underneath, mapping the car\u2019s
      every move, every rotation of the steering wheel and every inch backward. The
      windshield wipers squeaked as they brushed wet flakes off the glass, and within
      no time I was parked squarely between the cones.  \u201CNicely done,\u201D
      he exclaimed. \u201CFirst try, too.\u201D   \u201CThanks.\u201D  \u201CI won\u2019t
      make you do it again,\u201D he said, then hopped out to pick up the cones and
      place them back in the trunk. He bent over and peered through the passenger
      window. \u201CWow. I can\u2019t even see the tire tracks from when you drove
      in here.\u201D   I turned and looked at the entrance, but once again without
      warning my memories were taking over. I thought about the whole drive there
      and then the library. The warmth from the lights inside and the kids I saw
      reading in the nooks through the windows. The long, steep sledding hill, and
      how tomorrow there might be a new little girl there with her father, how they
      might think it\u2019s their own secret hill too, just the two of them. The
      old farmer\u2019s market and the soccer fields in the summertime, the parents
      who cheered on their daughter loudest even though she never touched the ball.
      I thought of all the other kids who one day would have to go through things
      they could never imagine, feel things they would never want to feel.   There
      was a certain stillness in that moment, that singular thought - the wind had
      let up and the snow fell softly for a few seconds, straight down to the earth.
      For the first time, I really looked at the driving instructor\u2019s face,
      the warmth from his eyes, the white flecks of snow gathering in his thinned
      hair. He was almost smiling, his mind elsewhere, and I imagined that soon he
      was going home to his wife and their kids. A small and modest house, but a
      true home. It was New Year\u2019s Eve for him too, after all. I pictured his
      wife holding two champagne glasses and his kids popping open those mini confetti
      cannons like Jamie and I used to. There in front of me was somebody else\u2019s
      father, somebody they looked up to, somebody else\u2019s everything. How lucky
      were they? How lucky had I been?  I thought about how one day I was eight and
      the next day I was eighteen. How I would have days where I felt even worse
      than I did today. And days where I felt better. I thought about finishing high
      school, how by the time I walked across the stage, all of this snow would just
      be a memory. The New Year\u2019s blizzard, we\u2019d call it. I\u2019d miss
      this moment too, when everything was vivid and painfully clear, when for the
      first time since August I felt my father\u2019s love again.  The last few months,
      I\u2019d come to believe that memories were the only place I could keep my
      Dad, and if somehow I lost them all to time, eventually I\u2019d have nothing
      left. But I realized there in the parking lot that so much of what I thought
      was me, was really him - my own brown eyes, the way I walked with long strides,
      the stupid old jokes I told, what I ordered at Chinese restaurants, how I held
      my mother when she was sobbing. Perhaps all of that was him too.  \u201CDo
      you want me to drive us back?\u201D the instructor asked me. \u201CSnow\u2019s
      getting pretty bad.\u201D  \u201CThat\u2019s okay, I\u2019ll drive,\u201D I

    name: Long Live the King
    content: "\"I was eight years old the first time I heard his name.\" Shifting
      in the hard plastic seat, my wrists are shackled to a metal chain link at the
      center of the table, limiting my mobility.  The officer observes my discomfort
      passively, already impatient and annoyed with my recollection of events.  \"I
      was thinking a little more recent, Miss Clark. Like why you were caught standing
      outside his home with a bloody\u2014\"  \"No, no, you don't understand. I need
      to start at the beginning. So you can understand,\" I enunciate, not trusting
      Officer Dougher, an overworked, underpaid, exhausted, dispassionate cop, to
      actually comprehend the beauty of my tale.  A tired sigh escapes me, not from
      lack of sleep but disappointment. Officer Dougher waves his fingers, gesturing
      for me to continue. I don't trust him, but this is the end of the line. The
      metal handcuff digs into my wrist as I adjust in my seat so I can really get
      into the story. Ignoring the pinching skin, I lean forward, welcoming him into
      my world.  I think back to that day, so many years ago now. Curled up in a
      ball on the lumpy, plaid couch, the edges of the cushions fraying, made worse
      when I ran my fingers along the seams. Shivering as the winds howled and rattled
      the single-pane glass windows of my friend's tiny cabin on Cliff Island, off
      the coast of Maine.   The day started bright and sunny, and like all the other
      kids who lived temporarily or year-round on the island, we spent every second
      playing in the ocean and cutting away debris through the woods like explorers
      and marauders. My best friend Ella had a neighbor, a boy who was older than
      us, maybe only a year or two, but at the time, the schism of our ages felt
      enormous.   He was tall. He spoke confidently and made fewer stupid jokes than
      the boys Ella and I went to school with on the mainland. Something about that
      island boy consumed me, and he was all I could think about as we explored the
      island that summer. I followed him bravely as we climbed up trees and leaped,
      clutching the makeshift swing as we flung ourselves into the water below. 
      As that particular day came to an end, I followed Ella, reluctant but resigned,
      back to her camp; the first dewy drops of rain wet our shoulders, and the shadows
      cast amongst the trees expanded. A storm was coming, you could smell it in
      the air.  By the time night fell, it was like a hurricane descended upon the
      island. Everything shook and howled and whistled, but the adults weren't concerned,
      and neither was Ella, so I forced myself to pretend I wasn't scared, too. 
      We curled up on the couch in the small den\u2014Ella called it the inside-outside
      room because although there were four walls and a roof, the floor-to-ceiling
      rattling glass windows still made you feel like you were outside. Hovering
      together under mounds of blankets, Ella's parents flipped through the channels
      of their old TV\u2014at that time, they could only get basic cable, and it
      sat like a gargantuan box on the floor, surrounded by towers of VHSs and DVDs\u2014and
      landed on a movie. A lime-green light and eerie music set the first scene. 
      Ella's parents argued over whether they should let us watch it or not. In the
      end, her mom sighed and told her dad he could be the one to deal with us girls
      if we were up all night crying from nightmares.  That's not what happened,
      though. Because I was eight years old and about to learn the name of the man
      who would change my life forever.  'What's this movie called?' I whispered
      to Ella, who loudly reiterated my question to her parents.  Her dad responded
      between chews of soggy popcorn, 'Tommyknockers.'  It was a weird movie. I felt
      like my mind was being twisted and warped and corrupted, then pet gently to
      rest when the movie came to an end.  'It's a Stephen King. You girls've heard
      of 'im, right? He's a Mainer,' her dad announced proudly. As if we had a claim
      to him. As if we should know him.  \"That was when my obsession started,\"
      I return to the present, explaining to the officer in front of me. His pen
      lifts off the yellow-lined notebook, sparking my curiosity. Why wouldn't he
      use a laptop to take my statement? Surely that would be easier?   I like the
      drama of the pen and yellow-lined pages. Like we're back in the fifties, and
      he's trying to get me to talk by making the room a little too hot and the light
      too bright. Any second now, his partner, the good cop, will come in here and
      offer me a cigarette and a whiskey.  \"Miss Clark,\" Officer Dougher prods,
      annoyed that I keep getting lost in my head.   \"I didn't play with the other
      kids the next day. I didn't care about the tall, handsome boy next door. After
      the movie ended, I asked Ella's parents about Stephen King, and her mom casually
      explained, while folding musty old blankets and picking up remnants from our
      slumber party in the inside-outside room, that she had a few of his books lying
      around somewhere. I just had to dig around and find them.\" I tell the story
      like I'm writing it down, with nuance and interiority.  \"You see,\" I tell
      the cop\u2014or is he a detective? His plain clothes point to the latter, but
      he's the same man who caught me outside the tall, gothic red mansion, handcuffing
      and stuffing me into the back of his cruiser. \"I spent that whole summer,
      hell, the entire next year reading The Dark Towers. I didn't understand half
      of what I was reading, needing a dictionary to help me translate nearly every
      line. But it was nothing like the books we were reading in school. I became
      obsessed.\"  Dougher reacts to this word. Obsessed. It's a trigger word, a
      small point against me, an indication that I wasn't quite right in the head. 
      \"That led me to other authors, of course. Ray Bradbury, Frank Herbert, Clive
      Barker, Douglas Adams. Then, as I got older, it became Atwood and Nin, Vonnegut
      and Palahniuk and Bukowski. I lost myself in\u2014\"  A gruff throat clearing
      interrupts my train of thought, and I glance up, wide-eyed and mystified, suddenly
      immersed in all those unspent feelings of my youth, trapped in a miasma of
      misanthropy and bibliophilic lust.   But Officer Dougher and his graying, whiskery,
      late-shaven face is disinterested in my passions. He wants the crux of the
      story, the meat of it, the spoilers. He doesn't want the prose or tension.
      Just give it to me, his eyes scream. Just admit what you did!  He would truly
      hate reading Tom Robbins.  He releases a long, suffering sigh when the door
      creaks open behind him, and a second officer, this one clad in standard blues,
      enters the room, holding a clear plastic evidence bag.  I wince when I see
      the contents.  The new cop drops the bag unceremoniously on the table between
      Dougher and me, then turns to leave. I look up, making eye contact with the
      camera in the corner of the room near the ceiling, the little red dot trained
      on me, recording my every move.  They'll later use the footage as evidence
      of my guilt; they'll tell people I bared myself open on the table, as raw and
      exposed as the smashed plastic and metal drone, now covered in dried blood
      in the plastic evidence bag, the camera above capturing my every thought and
      memory.   My erratic behavior, the evidence bag, and a signed confession are
      all Dougher wants from me, though, so I relax; he's only got two out of three. 
      Ignoring his impatience, I smile wistfully. \"That was when I began writing.
      I wrote and wrote and wrote. I took creative writing classes, I got a degree
      in English and Communications. But I kept getting rejection letters. Over and
      over again. And then one day,\" I lean forward, lowering my voice, pleased
      when Dougher mimics my posture, finally intrigued.  \"Then one day, I was in
      Bridgton at a Walgreens, and who's up at the prescription counter but Stephen
      fucking King.\"  Dougher lifts his eyebrows, not getting it. Not understanding.  
      I grunt. His ineptitude is exhausting. \"Anyway, when he walked past me, I
      couldn't help it; I tried to talk to him and I was so awkward, stumbling over
      my words. But he was so kind and polite. I told him I was writing horror, like
      him, and that he was my inspiration. That I fell in love with writing because
      of him, but I just couldn't get published. And do you know what he said?\" 
      \"What did he say?\"  \"He said, 'Not everyone can be scary.' And then he smiled
      that stupid, toothy smile and left.\"  Finally, finally, understanding dawns,
      the doughy man\u2019s cracked lips pressing together thoughtfully.  \"And that
      hurt your feelings? You wanted revenge? That's why you flew\u2014\"  \"No,
      of course it didn't hurt my feelings. It motivated me.\"  Dougher's pen stills
      on the yellow paper once more, glancing at me beneath his lashes. He's trying
      not to spook me or slow my momentous storytelling, but he also doesn\u2019t
      want to admit he\u2019s still confused.  \"Look. I was his biggest fan. But
      his last few books,\" I lift my palm, bound as it was to the table, and made
      a 'so-so' gesture with my hand. \"I think he just needed a little inspiration.
      It was kind of poignant, too, don't you think? Very Annie Wilkes of me.\" I
      smile proudly, but this idiot still looks confused.   \"Misery?\" Still, nothing.
      \"Kathy Bates?\"   Recognition passes his face, and I don't resist the eye-roll. 
      \"That's the one about the woman who's obsessed with the author, and she kidnaps
      him and makes him rewrite the story, right?\"  \"Very good, Dougher, even if
      you did get that from the movie. But did you know that Misery was inspired
      by another short story of a similar premise?\"  \"I did not. So\u2026 you identify
      with this\u2026 Annie Wilkes character, then?\"  I shrug.   \"Miss Clark\u2026
      what I really want to know is\u2026 what happened when you arrived at Mr. King's
      Bangor home at 12:36 AM this morning?\"  I glance back at the evidence bag,
      the broken drone, which I lost control of, and the smattering of blood on the
      plastic casing.  On the one hand, I could tell him the story of how it all
      went so sideways, not at all according to my plan.   Or, I could tell him what
      actually transpired while adding narrative, a creation of my own making.  \"Alright,
      Mr. Dougher. Here's the story of what happened last night when I arrived at
      Stephen King's mansion\u2026\""

    name: What Kind of Mother
    content: "Trigger Warning: infant/child loss, drowning  The day my daughter died,
      I became the villain of my own life story.  When your child dies of cancer,
      there are fundraisers and flower delivery vans and friends taking shifts sitting
      up with you through the long black nights and washing your hair.  When your
      child dies and it\u2019s your fault, there are no homemade casseroles filling
      your freezer, no one to hold your hair back as acrid vomit wracks your body
      through the early morning hours, bilious and yellow from the lack of meal trains
      organized on your behalf.  There are half-hearted assurances and crepe-thin
      oaths that you did nothing wrong, but no one holds your hand as you trudge,
      desperate and empty, behind a too-small casket, upturned palms wretchedly empty. 
      Because what kind of mother lets her daughter die? What kind of mother? What
      kind of mother?  --  Annie was born with a full head of chili-red hair.  \u201CIt\u2019s
      a girl!\u201D Chip cried, a tear coursing down his cheek, tinged green from
      his chronic, but now long forgotten, aversion to blood.  \u201CI\u2019m so
      proud of you,\u201D he whispered, and brushed an errant strand of hair, soaked
      with sweat, from my forehead, before planting a tender kiss on the top of my
      head.  \u201CI can\u2019t believe she\u2019s here.\u201D  --  In my worst moments,
      I imagine the last seconds of her life. Was she old enough, conscious enough
      of her own mortality, to know what was happening? I remember the bulging, terrified
      eyes of a newborn as a snug onesie is pulled down over their bulbous, disproportionate
      heads, and for one fleeting second they are in darkness, without air or sense
      or comfort. If an infant can feel horror, primordial, instinctual, then surely
      she must have felt the same?  Did she flounder, thrashing, splashing, grasping
      for someone? Or was she assured, in the way that babies are, that her mama
      would swoop in, be there any moment, save her? Was there a moment she realized
      help wasn\u2019t coming? Was she afraid? What images of her so-terribly-short
      life bathed the backs of her eyeballs as her brain slowly suffocated? Did she
      see my face? Did she feel something akin to betrayal? With her final fragment
      of consciousness, the last fire of a synapse, did my daughter\u2019s brain
      shriek, Where is my mama?  In the best moments, I have hope that perhaps she
      simply floated, weightless and peaceful, from the shores of this life, bobbing
      in the wake of her own tumble, until the over-chlorinated cocoon that carried
      her away from me faded into stardust and eternity.  On bad days, I know, in
      my deepest, most terrible self, that she didn\u2019t.  --  Her gummy smile
      used to crack her face open, her mouth stretched wide, as if she couldn\u2019t
      contain all that joy within one terribly small person, as if it needed an outlet
      to pour out of.  --  In the long, horrible days that came after, reporters
      from KJTV and WP10 and who knows where else congregated in threadbare clusters
      at the end of our road, loping tentatively toward our home from time to time,
      craning their necks and their cumbersome cameras over our cinderblock fence,
      trying to catch a shot of the pool, or of me, or, in a best case scenario,
      of me lying prone, beating my fists against the chipped terracotta tiles by
      the pool, I suppose? I thought about it, more than once.  Eventually Chip brusquely
      cleared the block, physically shooing the sensible pump-clad and contoured
      reporters away from our home. \u201CLeave us alone, please,\u201D I heard him,
      his voice catching on a suppressed sob.   \u201CMr. Sutton,\u201D a bright
      voice, dripping with flimsy concern, peeled. \u201CDo you blame your wife for
      what happened to your daughter?\u201D  Chip\u2019s voice was gruff. \u201CMy
      wife loved Annie. Please, we lost our girl. Leave us be.\u201D  When the front
      door slammed behind him, his eyes traveled up to meet mine. He nodded stiffly,
      and padded to his office, the door clicking closed behind him.  --  She only
      took contact naps. She\u2019d open her bleary, inky blue eyes and I\u2019d
      watch as the fog of sleep lifted, her momentary panic, her pupils contracting
      until they focused on my hovering face. And then the smile, that earth-shattering
      smile- relief and unbridled delight. Ah, you\u2019re still here, it seemed
      to say. \u201CYou don\u2019t have to be afraid, Annie. I\u2019ll always be
      here,\u201D I whispered, lips fitting into the shallow valley of the bridge
      of her nose.  --  In the Sheriff\u2019s Office, they asked the same question
      in about a million ways: could she walk? How did we suspect she got out there
      so quickly? Was she still crawling? Eleven months is awfully young to be walking
      independently, wasn\u2019t it?  Eventually Chip asked, \u201CAre you implying
      that someone moved her out there? Are you trying to ask if someone put her
      out there on purpose?\u201D  The Sheriff waved the question away, a troublesome
      gnat zigzagging around the room, but its buzzing filled my ears until a migraine
      bloomed in my cerebellum and two deputies had to help me out to the Subaru,
      Chip three paces ahead. He opened the door and I spilled into the backseat.
      The ride home was silent, but for the buzzing question still flitting between
      us.  --  Her hot dog fingers would bury themselves into the depths of my thick
      hair and spool ribbons of it into her soft palms, pulling my face toward hers
      for a wet, open-mouthed kiss.  --  As it tends to do, the news cycle moved
      on, and our front yard fell silent.  It felt like a force field was cloaking
      our existence, because the world moved on without us- without her- and without
      the reporters furtively shifting through our trash, now no one acknowledged
      our existence, our loss, at all. Her name disappeared from the local papers.
      The medical examiner, and social services, and the crematory, satisfied now,
      all stopped calling, stopped dropping in unannounced. I felt invisible, but
      for the realtor\u2019s terse jerk of the head in our direction, mumbling something
      to a prospective buyer as she ushered them inside our neighbors\u2019 home,
      which had been abruptly listed for sale.  It was just Chip and me and a stack
      of pink and yellow-striped birthday presents piled up in the corner of the
      living room that I couldn\u2019t bear to move, even though my entire being
      vibrated with agony with every glance in their direction.  But then, suddenly,
      it was just me.  The divorce papers called our marriage \u201Cirretrievably
      broken\u201D.   \u201CWhile Mr. Sutton believes that Mrs. Sutton was not maliciously
      responsible for the death of their child, it is indisputable that Mrs. Sutton\u2019s
      actions directly led to her death, the strain of which has contributed to the
      total and irreconcilable breakdown of the marriage.\u201D  --  \u201COh, Annieeee,\u201D
      I trilled as I walked back into the living room, fingers sliding my second-day
      blowout through the second loop of a hair tie on autopilot. Paw Patrol filled
      the room with a campy beat.  I didn\u2019t notice that she wasn\u2019t in her
      spot on the couch so much as the back door was open.  I froze.  Through the
      open blinds, I saw it.  A mass of matted red hair bobbing just above the nearly-still
      surface of the pool. The blob of pink fleece footie pajamas blurred through
      the lens of the water.  And then I was thrashing through waist-deep water,
      cutting my way toward her, fumbling to lift her head out of the water as it
      flopped haphazardly about, all the tension released from her tendons and sinews,
      heavy with water.  This was not reality. Couldn\u2019t be. This was an unwanted
      image flitting through my brain, another intrusive thought, like how each time
      I descended the staircase the picture sprang to my mind, unbidden, of fumbling,
      dropping her down the stairs, her doughy body thumping down each tiled step,
      punctuated by sharp cries, until there was only silence and one final thud.
      And then I\u2019d close my eyes, shake my head, and the horror would fall away
      like ash, and she\u2019d be there, gurgling and happy, tongue tentatively poking
      at her newest tooth, and okay. She was always okay.  No, no, no.  My brain
      buzzed with only this word, beating out a frantic rhythm that kept pace with
      my racing heart. There was no sound; no splashing or the sodden squelch of
      laying her on the cold deck tiles, but I would read later than the neighbors
      called the ambulance when they heard my screams.  No, no, no. It was only three
      minutes.  Her eyes were half-open, almost sleepy, like when she fell asleep,
      milk-drunk and content at my breast. Peaceful, like she\u2019d never known
      fear.  Oh god, had she been afraid?  But she was horrifically still. I knew,
      even as I slammed my palms against her sternum to the beat of Stayin\u2019
      Alive, like they\u2019d taught us in our parenting classes. She was still and
      gray in the way the stillborn son I\u2019d delivered as a teenager had been.
      \u201CYou\u2019re going to hell,\u201D my grandmother had spat as I sobbed
      over his fragile body, with its hazy skin already beginning to sag, completely
      devoid of a subterranean current of moving blood flushing his face. \u201CGod
      is punishing you.\u201D She called over her shoulder as she slammed the wardroom
      door shut behind her.  The paramedics peeled me off her like a second skin. 
      My fingers raked the air, reaching for her even as the frenetic scene unfolded
      around me, like one of those doubletime shots of traffic moving through an
      intersection, cars blurred into nothing but for their taillights streaking
      out behind them like the tail of a comet.  No, no, no.  \u2013  My therapist\u2019s
      office is dimly lit and layered with essential oil diffusers sending up gentle
      puffs of lavender-scented clouds, down-filled throw pillows, and a tinkling
      Buddha water fountain. It\u2019s intended to be soothing, but it feels more
      patronizing. I wince at a fluffy stuffed animal tucked into a shelf, tears
      pricking my eyelids. It seems exceptionally cruel for CPS to mandate my presence
      here now that I have no child.  Dr. Linda nods and smiles serenely from time
      to time, but mostly I sit and cry more than I say anything of note. I certainly
      don\u2019t feel rehabilitated or supported or like I have been aided in any
      sort of revelation about how I got here, to this nubby Ashley loveseat in this
      dark office.  Today I\u2019m angry.  (That\u2019s normal, Dr. Linda says.) 
      Today I rant. And I cry. And she nods and smiles and says, \u201CGo on.\u201D 
      Why is it that in true crime shows, as a victim lays clinging to life, they
      use their last breaths to name their killer?  Is it that vengeance burns in
      our bloodstreams even after the rest of our humanity has been flayed from our
      bones? Is laying blame more powerful than everything else?  These questions
      keep me up at night now, buffeting me with their sharp edges.  \u201CInteresting,\u201D
      Dr. Linda says. \u201CLet\u2019s explore that idea. What do you think Annie\u2019s
      last words would have been?\u201D  I\u2019m momentarily paralyzed by the exercise. 
      \u201CAnnie had only learned one word when she died.\u201D My voice is rough,
      and the words taste so bitter I spit them out.   \u201CMama.\u201D"

      the gate, crammed along the hill all the way down to the sea. The water glistens
      salmon and cornflower blue, a glassy mirror of the sky above.   In the fading
      summer sun, you send off the last of the holiday. Six days in Corfu, lazing
      by tepid pools that stretch out from two adjoining rooms. Fantastic views,
      boasts the website, a luxury experience at a modest price. The white walls
      hemming in each walnut deck between room and pool frame the hotel courtyard,
      still in the throes of construction, slate tiles and half-empty gravel sacks
      nestled under meagre cypress trees.   The last pink sliver melts into the horizon.
      You sigh. Dad sighs louder, hands steepled over his belly. Hannah takes a picture.
      Ryan snaps a selfie. The sliver rises again.   It climbs faster and faster,
      and everything becomes lighter, brighter, too bright, clinical white, nothing. 
      ***  \u201CAnd then there was another Mark,\u201D Dad recalls, sending the
      table into an encore of laughter.   Not far enough. Try again.  The sun scrubs
      across the sky, west to east.  ***  Four of you arrive in prickly silence,
      three steering over-packed cases around potholes the size of small dogs. You,
      sans-luggage, glowering at the rear. Arguments had bookended both airports,
      now everyone ignores one another. Dad had insisted in taking your bags with
      his. You\u2019d declined, he\u2019d taken them anyway. You\u2019d snapped,
      he\u2019d started grumbling. He leads the sour trail, lugging weight he can
      scarcely bear, refusing anyone\u2019s help.  Too far.  The sun jumps forward
      until it becomes the moon and then the sun again, twice over. Day crawls on.
      The shadows shrink.  That\u2019s better.  Floating on a neon green lilo, at
      the spot where the wall meets the veranda and shadows cool the air, you flex
      scarlet-painted toes in the water. Something vaguely blue and sticky-looking
      clings to the edge of the cracked white sill. A string of ants parade over
      the fissures. Dad snores from the deck, jet-engine loud. Luckily, the kids
      don\u2019t have to share a room with him this time.   It\u2019s so far away,
      what if something happens? Your mother\u2019s words find you in the shade.
      You\u2019d exhausted yourself on the plane trying to chase them away, hence
      your especially acetic mood on arrival.  It\u2019s only a four-hour flight.
      You weren\u2019t going to let her guilt you this time. Besides, this\u2019ll
      probably be Hannah\u2019s last trip with us. Hidden behind purple-tinged sunnies,
      you grow drowsy, mouth parting as you slip in and out of sleep.  Gentle splashes
      from over the wall \u2013 Hannah, paddling over to Ryan. \u201CWe should get
      them something, like we used to.\u201D   Ceramic camper van from Devon, lilac
      and palm-sized. Plastic magnet of Brighton Pier. Wooden turtle from Spain,
      missing one leg thanks to less-than-careful treatment in the front pocket of
      a backpack on the way home. Tokens of thanks, from whatever was left of their
      spending money. Little treasures.   Ryan grunts. \u201CProbably just sit around
      the house with all the other tat.\u201D  The kids think you and Dad hang on
      to things. Piles of bills from 2009 crowd the corners of the lounge. Bits of
      broken God-knows-what litter the shelf in the hallway, moved for dusting, put
      right back after. On the landing, stacks of old schoolwork; every report card
      Hannah\u2019s ever had. Within a year, the tat will have doubled.  \u201CTrue.\u201D
      Hannah sighs.  ***  The next morning, you convince Dad to join them \u2013
      your own pool is being cleaned, the little robotic vacuum trundling merrily
      along the mosaic floor. Heat spikes your soles as you step onto their deck,
      nearly sending you hopping into the clothes horse by the door. Hannah\u2019s
      white paisley bikini from yesterday dangles off one tier like an aged cut of
      meat. Ryan\u2019s black swimming trunks are puddled on the floor. You don\u2019t
      even notice yourself hanging them back up.   A huddle of thirtysomethings clad
      in variations of the same striped shirt bounce down the path at the end of
      the pool as you wade toward the kids. One elbows his friend, laughing heartily,
      and you catch the end of his teasing.  \u201C- just be normal for once, mate.\u201D 
      Hannah snaps her head towards Ryan, whose eyes glint in recognition. They\u2019re
      an even closer shade to yours than Hannah\u2019s.  \u201COh, nor-mil.\u201D
      Ryan croons in a high-pitched voice.  Hannah laughs back, \u201COh, very nor-mil!\u201D 
      \u201CWhat\u2019s that?\u201D you ask, worried you\u2019ve missed something
      important.  \u201CNothing.\u201D Ryan shakes his head, smiling.   Hannah waves
      you off with a hand. \u201CDoesn\u2019t matter.\u201D  And they bow their chins
      and snicker.   Being an only child, you doubt you\u2019ll ever understand their
      bond. You imagine it\u2019s the same camaraderie Dad and Jane might have shared
      when they were young. Those two haven\u2019t seen each other since they buried
      their own mother a decade ago. They learn each others\u2019 lives via Facebook
      messages, tallying birthdays and Christmases and wedding anniversaries. Jane
      only lives two hours away.  \u201CI\u2019d hate to end up like that,\u201D
      Hannah had told you once.   But this is the only inside joke they\u2019ve shared
      all year.   The day passes. You send the sun away, reel it back, yoyo it between
      now and then and never.  ***  This time, the kids come over to your side \u2013
      their turn with the vacuum \u2013 and claim both wicker sun loungers on the
      deck. Grey cushions are a considerable oversight, so close to the water, but
      one that at least feels on-brand for the hotel.  After an hour pruning in the
      water - the kids eventually grew antsy and followed you in - you excuse yourself;
      it\u2019s time to ring Nana.  Dad is waiting when you return.  \u201CI\u2019m
      sure she\u2019ll call the ambulance if she needs,\u201D he says with a reassuring
      pat on your shoulder when you relay the news. \u201CShe can take care of herself
      for a few more days.\u201D   You were fairly sure Hannah had pieced together
      by now that he wasn\u2019t particularly favoured by your mother, and that he
      didn\u2019t overly care for her in return.  You chew your lip. \u201CI don\u2019t
      know.\u201D  The kids pop up from the water, settling elbow to sunburnt elbow
      on the deck.  \u201CHow is she?\u201D Hannah says, a pleasantry.  \u201CShe
      alright?\u201D Ryan asks, a formality.   They don\u2019t speak with her much,
      at their age.   She isn\u2019t \u2013 alright, that is. Days after you land
      back in London, Nana will be hospitalised. Stomach cancer, most likely, but
      she\u2019s too weak to do any investigating, and too far gone for it to make
      any difference.   \u201CJust some tummy pain,\u201D you say. Deep creases have
      carved a permanent home between your brows.   You smile across the dinner table
      that night, a ropy approximation of happy. Several times, you catch Hannah
      watching you with thinned lips, like she\u2019s trying to figure out when exactly
      you started pretending.  The sun sets. The sun rises.  ***  On what might be
      the fourth day, or the second, or the fifth, you seek out Hannah on the deck
      next door, under the cover of the slatted veranda. She watches you sit down,
      hand shielding her eyes from the sun, assessing your dark circles, the way
      your skin hangs looser than it used to.  \u201CYou okay?\u201D Hannah asks.
      She wants you to tell her the truth: you aren\u2019t, you haven\u2019t been
      for a while. She wants to be able to help.   You nod, smile, lean back and
      open your book. \u201CJust tired.\u201D  The family has watched you drain for
      years. By October, you will be empty.  \u201CWhat you reading?\u201D you ask,
      nodding to the tablet propped against her legs.  \u201CSort of a mythological
      retelling. It\u2019s good.\u201D Hannah says. \u201CWhat\u2019s yours?\u201D 
      \u201CMurder mystery.\u201D  \u201CNice.\u201D  She\u2019s always been an avid
      reader, the payoff of night after night spent giving in to her little clasped
      hands, badgering for just one more story before bed. The social skills, well.
      You can\u2019t get everything right, says the first voice.  Then the second
      creeps in. If you\u2019d taken the kids on more proper holidays \u2013 the
      exciting ones, the ones their school friends went on, with theme parks, and
      watersports, and swanky beach-front resorts \u2013 would she be more adventurous,
      more sure of herself? Family holidays with you had been caravan parks, budget
      hotels, croissants and satsumas smuggled from breakfast, produced later from
      Dad\u2019s cargo shorts to save on food. You\u2019d have liked to go bigger.
      You could\u2019ve afforded it, just about. Dad always talked you down. All
      those pennies pinched, all those trips untaken, and for what? The spare cash
      barely even covered Hannah\u2019s packing list.  \u201CWe\u2019ll have to go
      to Ikea when we\u2019re back,\u201D you remind yourself aloud. She still needs
      towels, bedding, kitchen things.   Hannah nods emphatically, frizzy topknot
      bouncing against her head. \u201CYes, definitely.\u201D   In the end, Dad will
      take her, help her pick out plates, bowls, a trio of varying-sized navy towels,
      whilst you hover around a hospital bed, too distressed to watch, too distraught
      to look away.  The veranda\u2019s shadows offer little relief from the heat,
      and soon Hannah retreats inside to the AC. Sweat stains linger on the sun lounger
      long after she\u2019s gone. The rest of the day ticks away.   You gather round
      the table: Hannah, Ryan, Dad, Mum. Mum, Ryan, Dad, Hannah. Ryan, Hannah, Mum,
      Dad. A hundred times, the order changes. It never matters.  The sun sets, unsets,
      sets again.  ***  \u201COne more round?\u201D Dad asks. The three of you nod,
      Ryan stands to accompany him. It\u2019s the final night again, or some version
      of it.  You scooch your chair close to Hannah\u2019s, and the screech of metal
      on concrete judders through your bones. When you draw an arm around her, you
      half expect she\u2019ll shrug it off. Still, in that insufferable second where
      she tenses, your heart splinters. But then she loosens, leans her head on your
      shoulder. You hold your daughter for the last time that counts.  \u201CI don\u2019t
      hug you enough,\u201D you frown into her hair, now shea butter and coconut.
      The milky newborn halo only seems like last week. \u201CI don\u2019t know why
      I don\u2019t.\u201D  She hums.  Nana will go two days before Ryan\u2019s 16th,
      and you will tell Hannah, hundreds of miles away, over the phone.   \u201CWe
      talked about taking you to Disneyland, once,\u201D you say, through an ache
      in your chest you can\u2019t imagine being without.  \u201CThat would\u2019ve
      been nice.\u201D Hannah muses, watching the sun dip below the horizon.   You
      tug the headset off, hold down the button on the side until it turns red. Rise
      from the bed in the spare room, surrounded by a dead woman\u2019s things, and
      trudge downstairs.  Dad is waiting in the lounge.  \u201CYou alright, dear?\u201D
      He lunges for a tissue, thrusts it into your hand, eyes the blue of the Ionian
      sea darting worriedly over your face. He\u2019s greyed since that summer. You
      aren\u2019t sure if you love him anymore. You can\u2019t remember if you still
      did then.  \u201CI\u2019m fine.\u201D You sniff, dabbing at your eyes. The
      tissue comes away damp, flecked with mascara. You both settle on the sofa and
      wait for the call.   Hannah\u2019s name illuminates the phone screen. You answer
      on the second ring. Her face appears in miniature, navy towel binding her wet
      hair. It\u2019s been a trying week \u2013 tell you later, she\u2019d texted
      at lunchtime. Okay x, you\u2019d replied, speak soon. She\u2019s tucked up
      on her desk chair again, chin resting on her knees. Gold-rimmed glasses throw
      soft shadows onto her cheeks, flushed pink from the shower.  \u201CHello,\u201D
      she says, \u201CCan you hear me?\u201D."
